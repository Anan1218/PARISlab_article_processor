The sum of concentration of the four presented elements was normalized to 100 wt.--%. Lines indicate minimum and maximum contents reported in Matthes et al. (2018) [1]. The blue patch indicates possible range of composition within those limits. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 1 Fig. 2 XRD scans of unhydrated GGBS. All GGBS have a high amorphous content. Crystalline phases were modelled for GGBS 15 and GGBS 13 using Rietveld refinement. GGBS 15 contains 3.8 wt.% spinel and GGBS 13 2.6 wt.% akermanite. For all other slags crystalline signal was too low to be modelled. However, traces of merwinite and/or akermanite were detected in GGBS 1, GGBS 2, GGBS 4, GGBS 11, GGBS 16. Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Granulometric curves of 16 ground industrial GGBS samples, after applying the same grinding protocol. Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Isothermal calorimetry results applying the four different methods to 6 selected GGBS. (a) Method described by Kashani et al. (2014) [29], (b) method by Snellings and Scrivener (2016) [20], (c) R3 test described by Avet et al. (2016) and Li et al. (2018) [19,22] and (d) calorimetric test using GGBS/clinker mixture (75:25) and sulfates according to EN 196\u20131 [31]. Note the different time scale for (d). All heat measurements are normalized to slag mass in the vessel. Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Heat of hydration of GGBS 2 and GGBS 14 samples ground to different specific surface values, using the modified R3 protocol. Vertical error bars correspond to 2RSD intervals as described above. Horizontal error bars correspond to an average error of ±100 cm2/g for the Blaine method. Fig. 5 Fig. 6 Heat of hydration of the whole set of 16 GGBS, plotted against 2d compressive strength test results. Vertical error bars correspond to 2RSD intervals as described above. Fig. 6 Fig. 7 XRD patterns of pastes hydrated for 24 h using R3 protocol.

Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is a glassy by-product of pig iron production and is commonly used in concrete industry to replace cement and thereby lower the carbon footprint of the material. Large variations in reactivity exist depending on the GGBS physical and chemical features. Here we investigate the ability of three rapid calorimetric methods to evaluate the reactivity of GGBS. On a set of 16 industrial GGBS, we show that 24 h heat release, using the R3-protocol, correlates well with 2d compressive strength of standard mortars using 75 wt% GGBS. The correlation of R3-test results (R2 = 0.87) is better than for traditional reactivity indices calculated from chemical composition. Furthermore, we present data on the repeatability of the test protocol and show that the R3-protocol is very sensitive to sample fineness. Finally, XRD patterns show that slight differences in phase assemblage exist between the most and least reactive GGBS. 1 Introduction Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is a glassy by-product of pig iron production and has been used in blended cements for over 140 years [1]. Besides economic aspects the use of GGBS at high substitution levels has the advantage of lowering CO2 footprint of concrete, decreasing heat development during setting and increasing physical and chemical resistance of the material [1\u20136]. However, short term compressive strength development of GGBS is below that of original Portland cement (OPC), but reactivity under same conditions, can differ widely between different GGBS [1,4,7\u201310]. The intrinsic reactivity of GGBS depends on different parameters as chemical composition, glass content and structure or quenching parameters of the slag [1,9,11\u201313]. This makes modification of production parameters of GGBS \u2013 so called upstream modification - a promising route to increase its reactivity [13\u201315]. Another way to increase the reactivity of GGBS is the modification of the activation system (downstream) by increasing fineness, increasing reaction temperature, adapting solution chemistry or by adding chemical activators as CaCl2 [16\u201318]. The present work originates in the European research project Actislag, aiming to develop a second generation GGBS reaching cement substitution rates of 80 wt% while keeping the specifications of CEM II. Therefore, both activation routes are considered: upstream modifications of GGBS chemistry/microstructure and downstream modifications of the activation system. In order to reach the research goals, it is essential to be able to quickly assess the reactivity of a large number of GGBS. Furthermore, as upstream modifications will be tested in lab scale trials, minimal sample mass should be used for the reactivity tests. A multitude of test methods are available to predict the reactivity of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM). Usually chemical tests are used to predict short term compressive strength, see Snellings and Scrivener (2016) and Li et al. (2018) for a review [19,20]. Standardized test methods use Ca consumption during hydration of the SCM (e.g. Chapelle test, Frattini test). These were designed for pozzolanic material and are difficult to apply to slags, as GGBS contain a substantial amount of reactive Ca [19]. Further methods aim to determine the degree of reaction of SCMs: most notably selective dissolution, SEM-IA, XRD, and NMR (27Al or 29Si) are presented in scientific literature but are often time consuming and with moderate accuracy at early age [21]. In recent publications heat development during hydration of a simplified system showed good correlation with compressive strength of different SCM containing mortars [19,20,22]. In these studies, a sulphate containing alkaline solution is added to a mix of portlandite, carbonates and the respective SCM. The heat development during the following reaction is measured by isothermal calorimetry. The reaction can be accelerated by increasing the temperature conditions. This setup avoids the use of other hydraulic material as OPC, and thus the risk of overprinting the signal of intrinsic SCM reactivity [23\u201325]. By this protocol a wide range of SCMs including GGBS, fly ash, natural pozzolans and calcined clays were tested and classified according to their reactivity. In Avet et al. (2016) the simplified test was used to predict the pozzolanic activity of 7 calcined clays, naming it R3 test [22]. In that study a good prediction of compressive strength of mortars containing 30 wt% calcined clays was obtained after 1d of calorimetric measurement at 40 °C for all setting ages. Li et al. 2018 reached a good prediction of 28d compressive strength of mortars at a replacement rate of 30 wt% of cement by different SCMs. They used the same calorimetric test, but the best correlation between 28d compressive strength and heat development was reach for 3 and 7d of calorimetric measures. Other studies used a similar test design to determine hydraulic or pozzolanic properties of different materials, including GGBS [26\u201328]. However, it was never attempted to use the R3test to rank different GGBS according to their early age reactivity. Another promising method to judge GGBS reactivity in literature is proposed by Kashani et al. (2014) [29]. In this study pure 1 M NaOH is used as activation system which gives exploitable results in <12 h in ambient temperature isothermal calorimetry, nevertheless no comparison between different GGBS was attempted. In the present study, 16 industrial GGBS from different sources were examined in terms of composition and mechanical performance in binder pastes. Subsequently different calorimetric protocols existing in literature were tested in order to develop a rapid and reliable method using minimal sample mass to evaluate GGBS short term performance in cementitious systems. The three main objectives of this study are: 1. Evaluation of existing calorimetric tests for the assessment of young age compressive strength of GGBS. Main focus is on protocols based on the R3test and the optimization of grinding parameters. 2. Application of an optimized calorimetric test on a set of 16 industrial slags and comparison of test results with actual compressive strength values in order to evaluate the capacity of the test to evaluate the reactivity of different GGBS. 3. Discussion of sources of differences in reactivity of the analyzed GGBS, especially chemical composition of the slags and mineral phases formed during the calorimetric test. 2 Materials 2.1 Chemical composition of industrial GGBS In order to represent a wide range of today's GGBS compositions, 16 different slags were selected from the FEhS database (FEhS \u2013 Institut für Baustoff-Forschung e.V., Duisburg, Germany). Chemical composition was measured on fused tabs by XRF (Panalytical Zetium). The composition was calculated conventionally as oxides (Table 1 ). Major element compositions and maximum values from literature are displayed in Fig. 1 . CaO contents in our dataset are between 29.0 and 43.2 wt%. The lowest value is lower than lowest values reported in literature, but the highest value is also 4.3 wt% lower than maxima reported [1]. Most GGBS in our dataset contain between 40 and 42 wt% CaO. SiO2 contents in our GGBS set range from 34.6 to 39.2 wt%, a distribution that is on both ends about 2% smaller than the extreme values for GGBS from different regions of the world reported in Matthes et al. (2018) [1]. For Al2O3 the observed concentrations range between 6.8 and 20.1 wt%, which corresponds to extreme values reported in literature [1]. However, only GGBS 15 attains such a high Al2O3 content (20.1 wt%), the next lower sample (GGBS 14) contains 13.7 wt% Al2O3. The majority of selected GGBS contain between 10 and 12 wt% Al2O3. MgO contents in our sample set are between 6.12 and 11.6 wt%, both extrema are 3 wt% below extreme values reported by Matthes et al. (2018) [1]. In the studied GGBS, TiO2 contents range for 0.27 to 3.02 wt%, with 3.02 wt% of TiO2 in GGBS 9. The extreme values again correspond to the values observed by Matthes et al. (2018) [1]. In contrast, most GGBS contain between 0.5 and 1 wt% TiO2. Reactivity indices were calculated according to the composition data. Glass content of the 16 GGBS was measured by optical transmission light microscopy at FEhS. The sample was grounded in an agate mortar and the 40\u201363 μm fraction was embedded in Canada balm. Then, glass content (in vol.%) was measured on individual grains, using a lambda plate and polarisators 1000. The method is described in detail in Drissen (1994) [30]. Glass content of all slags was >99.8 vol.%, only exceptions were GGBS 14 (98.2 vol.%) and GGBS 15 (94.5 vol.%). Furthermore, XRD scans were performed on the unhydrated slags (Fig. 2 ). The measurement parameters were the same as described in Section 3.3. Rietveld refinement using rutile as external standard gave an amorphous content of 96.2 wt.% and 3.8 wt.% of Spinel in GGBS 15. This is well in line with glass content measurements. In GGBS 13, amorphous content 97.4 wt.% and 2.6 wt.% of akermanite were modelled, slightly more than expected from glass content measurements. In all other samples, the crystalline signal was too weak to be modelled by Rietveld refinement, in line with glass content measurements. However, traces of merwinite were detected in GGBS 4 and GGBS 16, and traces of akermanite in GGBS 1, GGBS 2, GGBS 11 and GGBS 16. 2.2 Other materials The chemical composition of the clinker used for compressive strength tests is reported in Table 2 . XRD analysis followed by Rietveld refinement gave a mineral composition of 60.9 wt% C3S, 21.5 wt% C2S, 0.9 wt% orthorhombic C3A, 7.8 wt% cubic C3A and 6.6 wt% C4AF. Density was 3.093 g/cm3 and fineness 4200 cm2/g (Blaine). Further reactants used were K2SO4 (VWR, REACTAPUR), KOH (VWR, AnalaR Normapur), Ca(OH)2 (Merck, ACS Reagent, for analysis). Water used for calorimetric tests was always pure (18.2 MΩ). 3 Methods 3.1 Compressive strength tests Mortar strength tests according to EN 196-1 were performed in order to evaluate reactivity of GGBS [31]. A batch of 5 kg of each GGBS was ground in a ball mill using a mixture of steel spheres and cylinders. To achieve a fineness of about 4200 cm2/g according to EN 196-6, the grinding time was about 3 h [32]. However, the decisive parameter to evaluate the achieved fineness was the particle size distribution measured by laser diffraction granulometry (Horiba LA 300). Based on a weighted double logarithmic transformation according to the RRSB method, the PSD parameters d\u2032 (d63.2%) and n (slope) were calculated. For each sample, 6 standard prisms (4 × 4 × 16 cm3) were made using 75 wt% of GGBS and 25 wt% of clinker according to EN 196\u20131, subsequently adding 4.5 wt% of SO3, in form of a mixture of 25 wt% gypsum and 75 wt% anhydrite. A water binder ratio of 0.5 was used. Compressive strength tests were performed after 1d, 2d, 7d, 28d and 91d storing times at 20 °C under water. 3.2 Isothermal calorimetry All calorimetric tests were carried out using a TAM Air isothermal calorimeter by TA-instruments. Samples were prepared in 10 mL polypropylene recipients. The pastes were hand stirred using a glass bar until no agglomerates or layering was visible anymore. Only exception was the 7d calorimetric test using clinker, based on EN196\u20139, for which samples were prepared in a 20 mL admixture cell [33]. Results of calorimetric measurements were normalized to GGBS mass in the vessel. 3.3 Characterization of hydrated phases Hydrates were characterized directly after the calorimetric measurements. The hydrated slag sample was crushed in an agate mortar and the resulting powder was briefly suspended in a stirred beaker containing isopropanol to remove remaining water. The powder was then recovered through vacuum filtration and the sample was rinsed with acetone three times. Finally, the dry powder retained by the filter was directly used for XRD analysis on a Brucker D8 using a Cu-cathode. Scan duration was 65 min for angles from 2 to 70°. The sample preparation from calorimeter to the start of XRD scan took <1 h. 3.4 Method adaption for estimation of slag reactivity In a first step, three modified, rapid test protocols from literature, described in Table 3 , were tested for their capacity to predict compressive strength of slag-based mortars. The R3-protocol was modified in the sense that no calcite addition was used and the test proposed in Snellings and Scrivener 2016 was modified by reducing the amount of Ca(OH)2 and not adding sulfates to the mix [19,20,22]. Therefore, six GGBS, covering a wide range of reactivity, were selected. Furthermore, heat development under the same conditions as the compressive strength tests (adding 25 wt% clinker, and anhydrite/gypsum to reach 4.5 wt% SO3) was measured. For these tests, the same grinding protocol as for compressive strength tests was used. Next, the repeatability of the R3-protocol was tested measuring 7 times the same powder (GGBS 11) to calculate errors associated with the calorimetric method. Subsequently, the same granulate (GGBS 14) was ground six times and analyzed with the modified R3-test. Therefore, the samples were ground using a Retsch RS100 disc mill. 15 g of each GGBS was put in a 50 mL tungsten carbide bowl for 1 min at 1400 rpm to a Blaine fineness of 4100 ± 100 cm2/g [32]. As the repeatability of the whole protocol was judged sufficient, the grinding process and the R3 calorimetric measurements were applied to the set of 16 industrial GGBS. The particle size distribution was measured on a CILAS 1090 laser diffraction granulometer operating with ethanol to check repeatability of the grinding protocol (Fig. 3 ). Three successive measurements in Fraunhofer mode were carried out on each powder sample. Samples received 3 × 30 s ultrasonic treatment before measurement in order to avoid agglomerations. The PSD analysis gave d10 values between 1.6 and 1.8 μm and d50 values between 8.5 and 10.5 μm. These values were judged sufficiently close to exclude a major influence of sample finesse. In addition, 50 g of GGBS 2 and GGBS 14 samples were ground for 2 × 30 s, 3 × 30 s, 4 × 30 s and 5 × 30 s in the 250 mL bowl described above, in order to be able to quantify the impact of fineness on calorimetric measurements. 4 Results 4.1 Chemical and mechanical analysis of GGBS Mean compressive strength values are 2.8, 9.9, 30.7, 44.8 and 53.9 MPa at 1d, 2d, 7d, 28d and 91d, respectively (Table 4 ). Measured compressive strength values logically increase with time for all samples. Compressive strength after 1 d is between 2.0 MPa in GGBS 9, the sample with the highest TiO2 content, and 3.9 MPa in GGBS 2 and GGBS 11. This means a relative difference of almost a factor 2 in mechanical performance between different slags. Note that no compressive strength measurements are available for GGBS 15 and GGBS 16 at this age. After 2 d, measured values range from 3.7 (GGBS 16) to 17.1 MPa (GGBS 15), making up for difference of more than a factor 4 between the least and most reactive slag. These two are also the samples with the respectively lowest and highest Al2O3 contents (Table 1). The relative standard deviation (RSD) of compressive strength tests between samples increases to 38.4% at 2 d time. RSD between samples then decreases over time (24.2% after 7d and 14.3% after 28 d) and is as low as 12.5% after 91 d. After 7d, 28d and 91d time, GGBS 11 developed highest compressive strength (40.0, 54.3 and 62.4 MPa, respectively), this is also the sample with the highest CaO content (Table 1). This slag was already the most effective after 1d when no data for GGBS 15 was available, but overtaken by GGBS 15 at 2d. The relative performance of GGBS 15, the sample with the highest Al2O3 content and the lowest CaO content decreased over time. GGBS 16 continued to be the least reactive slag (12.0, 26.5 and 32.7 MPa, respectively). Note that the relative difference between the most and least reactive GGBS decreased at later ages. Between the extreme values, several slags interchanged their ranks at 7d, 28d and 91d, so that no clear tendency was visible. At 91d all GGBS have reached compressive strength values of >50 MPa, with only two exceptions (GGBS 15 and GGBS 16). 4.2 Reactivity indices Reactivity indices are routinely used to evaluate GGBS quality. For the set of 16 industrial GGBS, different reactivity indices were calculated based on oxide contents of GGBS (Table 1), using formulas commonly found in literature (see Matthes et al., 2018, for discussion and initial sources [1]). Only the F-value by Ehrenberg (2015) was added [35]. Correlation coefficients (Pearson's R2) between index values and measured compressive strength are given in Table 5 . Most reactivity indices do not explain more than a third of the variance (R2 < 0.33) observed in actual compressive strength measurements. Only the German standard for special cement, the basicity by Schwiete, the F-value by Keil and the F-value by Ehrenberg explain higher proportions of variance in compressive strength tests at some ages. Strongest correlations are found for 2d compressive strength for the F-value by Keil (R2 = 0.71), and Ehrenberg (R2 = 0.71) and the German standard for special cement (R2 = 0.78). At younger and older ages, correlations are less well defined. Only the basicity by Schwiete gives stronger correlations at 7d (R2 = 0.63) then after 2d (R2 = 0.51). The Schwiete basicity never drops below a correlation coefficient of 0.33 with R2 of 0.41, 0.39 and 0.33 for 1d, 28d and 91d, respectively. The Keil F-value also correlates well to 7d compressive strength (R2 = 0.43) but for all other ages drops below R2 = 0.33. The F-value according to Ehrenberg correlates well with 1d and 7d strength (R2 of 0.56 and 0.66 respectively) and the German standard for special cement only correlates with 1d compressive strength (R2 = 0.37). 4.3 Correlating heat of hydration to compressive strength 4.3.1 Choice of the method The results of heat measurement of 6 selected slags using different methods are reported in Table 6 . Note that heat values are normalized to slag mass in the measurement vessel. For all three rapid test methods the ranking of samples by heat development is similar. GGBS 13 is developing the least heat whereas GGBS 14 shows the most exothermic reaction. Only in the method by Kashani et al. (2014), without Ca addition, the lowest heat development is measured in GGBS 3 [29]. The methods taken from Snellings and Scrivener (2016) and the R3 test gave the same ranking and similar magnitudes of heat development [19,20,22]. However, the range of measured values is slightly larger in the R3-test (between 187 and 303 J/g) than in the protocol taken from Snellings and Scrivener (between 184 and 257 J/g). Divided by their respective mean heat values this gives a relative span of 47% for the R3-test and 31% for the Scrivener and Snellings (2016) protocol, showing that the R3-test has a better discriminatory capacity [19,20,22]. Heat development per mass GGBS is lowest in the test taken from Kashani et al. [29]. The range of the measured values between 35.5 and 43.8 J/g is low, even considering the low average heat of 40.1 J/g (relative span, 21% of the mean). In the method imitating compressive strength test by clinker addition, GGBS 11 has the highest heat development and GGBS 13 the least. The range of the data relatively close, between 308 and 366 J/g for an average of 335 J/g (17% of the mean), giving the test lowest discriminatory capacity of the four tested methods. Linear regression of heat values against compressive strength for different ages, show similar patterns for the three rapid methods. Accuracy of fit is judged by Pearson's R2 for linear regressions (Table 6). The best fit is achieved for 2d resistance values for the three model systems. The best correlation is calculated between the R3-test heat and 2d compressive strength with an R2 of 0.95, followed by the method taken from Snellings and Scrivener (2016) with an R2 of 0.92 [20]. These R2 values are similar to the correlation coefficients observed for calcined clay reactivity and 28d compressive strength of various SCMs [19,22]. Goodness of fit is progressively degrading towards higher and lower ages. Only the method taken from Kashani et al. 2014 shows a better fit for 91d old samples than for 28d and 7d old samples [29]. Generally, fits are less accurate for the Kashani et al. 2014 method, between 0.67 and 0.17. In the 7d method adding clinker, the distribution of Pearson's R2 values differs from the model systems [33]. In this method, best fit is calculated for 28d strength (0.68) and 2d strength (0.59). Surprisingly, the correlation coefficient for 7d compressive strength corresponding to the calorimetric measurement time of 7d is less well (0.47). However, the correlation coefficient is never as high as for the methods at 40 °C and Ca excess. Heat curves of the Kashani et al. (2014) method (Fig. 4 ) show different curve shapes for different samples, with for example heat development of GGBS 13 starting after about 7 h and then starting to overtake all other slags from 20 h on, also other heat curves intersect [29]. Also in the 7d test method and the R3-test some sample change ranks during the test. This makes the cutoff time a relevant parameter in the testing process. In literature, different cutoff times were proposed for the R3 test. In Avet et al. (2016), 1d measurements correlated well with compressive strength development of blended cements containing calcined clays at all ages [22]. Independent of SCM type it was found that 3d and 7d heat release by the R3-test correlated well with 28d compressive strength of 30% SCM blended cements, for various SCMs. 7d compressive strength was well correlated with all tested calorimetric cutoff times (0.5, 1, 3 and 7 d). The R3-test was retained for further investigation for its large span of heat values, best correlation with 2d compressive strength results and its easier sample handling due to high water content. 4.3.2 Method validation and sample preparation Validation of the R3 protocol showed good repeatability with a relative standard deviation of 0.87% of the mean value, when the same powder was used. (Table 7 ). The relative standard deviation increased to 1.59% when the same granulate was ground 6 times (Table 7). Measuring samples of different finesse points out the impact of specific surface on the heat of hydration using the modified R3-protocol (Fig. 5 ). The specific surface of the different samples was between 2500 ± 100 and 4800 ± 100 cm2/g, as determined by the Blaine method [32]. As expected, a higher reaction heat was measured when the samples were finer. Linear regression of reaction heat on Blaine value gave R2 values >0.95, thus proportionality can be assumed. Applying the regression function suggests, that reaction heat increased by about 4 J/g for each 100 cm2/g increase of reactive surface. 4.3.3 Application of the R3-test on the set of 16 industrial GGBS In a last step all industrial slag samples were measured using the retained, R3-protocol. GGBS 9 was the industrial slag with lowest heat development (144 J/g), whereas GGBS 15 showed highest reaction heat with 319 J/g. The heat development for the 16 slag samples correlates well with mortar compressive strength after 2 days (Table 4), as linear regression gave a R2 of 0.87 (Fig. 6 ). This correlation coefficient is higher than for any reactivity index. The method error was estimated to be 3.2% using the 2 RSD interval computed from the validation trial reported in Table 6. Taking into account this error, not all slags can be separated from each other but there is a clear tendency for higher heat values in more reactive slags. 4.4 Characterization of hydrates after calorimetric test After 24 h reaction time portlandite is still the major mineral phase in all samples as can be seen from the intense reflection at 18° in Fig. 7 . Besides, similar crystalline (ettringite, kuzelite) and amorphous phases (hydrotalcite) can be identified on XRD spectra in all slags after running the R3 calorimetric measurements (Fig. 7). However, marked differences exist in peak intensity. The kuzelite peaks are more intense in the most reactive slags, whereas ettringite peaks are virtually absent in those GGBS. In moderately reactive slags kuzelite, a monosulphate (Ca4Al2(SO4)(OH)12 6 H2O) and ettringite (Ca6Al2(SO4)3(OH)12 26 H2O) peaks coexist, whereas ettringite peaks are much more pronounced in least reactive slags. A broad hydrotalcite peak is visible in all slags, but most pronounced in the most reactive slag GGBS 15. The broad peak shape is likely due to variable compositions and especially in Mg/Al ratios of hydrotalcite. Also, hydrotalcite peaks overlap with those of monocarboaluminates. Even though source of carbonates are limited in our setting, both phases might be present. 5 Discussion 5.1 Differences in performance between different GGBS Important differences in strength development were observed for the different slags. Compressive strength results at different hydration ages can differ by as much as a factor 4 between different slags (Table 4). The highest dispersion of compressive strength is observed for the 2d time step, indicating a maximal influence of GGBS properties on compressive strength at this age. The highest dispersion and largest span make the 2d time step the most relevant for reactivity testing, besides the practical interest in a short-term reactivity test. At earlier ages, a major influence of clinker added is expected, due to its higher reaction rate [36]. At later ages, compressive strength values of different GGBS samples converge. In literature GGBS blended cements are known for ongoing hydration processes for long periods of time, also differences in reaction degree were still visible after 1 year [37]. This is consistent with the observation that strength development goes on until 91d in our study, furthermore hierarchy between most and least reactive slags stay the same indicating that some influence of GGBS composition is still visible. The exception is GGBS 15 with an extreme Al2O3 content. This sample shows the highest compressive strength at 2d but performs less well at later ages (Table 4). Similar behavior is known for slags with high Al2O3 contents [9,10,38,39]. In blended cements, increased Al2O3 content of GGBS was reported to enhance reaction heat and early age strength [37,38]. This is in contrast to results obtained for alkali activated GGBS and activation systems using waterglass, where high Al2O3 contents had no or a negative effect on compressive strength [40,41]. In our case, the lower long-term compressive strength of GGBS 15 appears to be due to the low CaO content (Table 1). The CaO content of GGBS is reported to control short range order of C-S-H in alkali activated materials [42]. These observations underline the importance of Al-bearing phases for early age compressive strength, and the importance of C-S-H phases for later strength development. Several reactivity indices correlate well with early age strength, all of them use CaO and Al2O3 as numerator (Table 5). Three of four also add MgO content as an asset. All divide by the SiO2 content. This homogeneity underlines that the first order influence of those elements on GGBS reactivity is well understood. It is interesting to note that the index with the highest correlation with 2d strength ((C + A + M) / S) can be approximated as (100 − S) / S, thus the reactivity can be resumed only by the SiO2 content of the slag [9]. All indices perform less well at later ages, underlining that strength development is less influenced by GGBS composition and reactivity at that stage. In the past Smolczyk 1978, used the same linear regression approach on a set of 196 GGBS, his regressions on 2d compressive strength in mortar systems gave lower R2 values [10]. This is likely due to higher and more stable glass contents and better control of minor elements in modern GGBS. Still, this underlines the importance of composition for GGBS reactivity. The mechanisms of influences of composition on GGBS reactivity are multiple. The chemical composition of liquid slag exerts a control on the formation of the glass network. The higher the content of network modifiers Mg, Ca, Na, K, the lower is the polymerization degree of the glass network resulting in a less stable slag, showing higher dissolution rates [43,44]. Higher dissolution rates imply a quicker liberation of ions to the liquid phase, which precipitate to give secondary minerals that may develop material strength. The role of other elements in glass stability is less clear, Al and Ti for example can act as both network formers and modifiers. NMR studies on GGBS indicate mainly 4-coordinated Al, indicating rather a network former role of Al [38,45]. However, GGBS composition is not the only factor controlling glass structure. Also physical parameters of the production process influence the glass structure, most importantly thermal history, determined mainly by tapping temperature and quenching speed [1,11,14,15,46]. The presence of different elements in the glass network also modifies the dissolution of the glass, the presence of network forming Al, for example increases the dissolution rate, as Al-O-Si sites are more easily attacked at high pH values than Si-O-Si groups [43]. In contrast, the insertion of other network formers like Zr slows down dissolution rates [47]. Chemical composition of GGBS also controls the element release into solution, as a congruent slag dissolution is expected [48,49]. Different stoichiometric ratios of elements can cause the formation of different secondary phases, as was observed in literature by XRD, SEM, DTG techniques and thermodynamic modelling of hydrated blended cements, and confirmed by XRD in this study [37]. For example MgO is essential for the formation of hydrotalcite like phases and their formation lowers the uptake of Al in C-A-S-H phases [39,50]. Also, in alkali activated binders higher MgO content was found to increase reactivity (Ben Haha et al., 2011) [50]. Durdzinski et al. (2017) argue that the type of hydrates is not important for strength development in blended cements and that the key factor is space filling [51]. In contrast, Thermkhajorkit et al. 2014 found that in OPC pastes C-S-H phases are more important in compressive strength development than other hydrates [52]. The multitude of mechanisms by that GGBS composition influence its reactivity make clear that a prediction of reactivity only based on differences in composition is complex. Even though, differences in composition might be the reason for differences in reactivity. Furthermore structural and physical properties of the slag are neglected, calling for a more integrative method for evaluating reactivity [9]. 5.2 Probing into reactivity using isothermal calorimetry In the first test using 6 selected GGBS, the two protocols using Ca(OH)2 addition at 40 °C showed the best correlation with 2 d compressive strength values (Table 6). We chose the R3 method based on Avet et al. (2016) and Li et al. (2018) for further investigation as sample handling was much easier due to higher l/s ratio and for higher absolute heat values and larger relative differences between samples [19,22]. Applied to the set of 16 industrial GGBS, the R3-test gives better correlation with 2d compressive strength (R2 = 0.87) in a 75 wt% GGBS 25 wt% clinker system, than any of the reactivity indices (Fig. 6). Similar reaction pathways in the different samples can be assumed as heat curve shapes are similar, only GGBS 11 shows a latency phase (Fig. 4). The R3-test thus gives an intrinsic reactivity of a given GGBS. This is especially interesting, as for the test no cement was used and thus it gives comparable results of GGBS reactivity, without bias associated to the use of cement whose composition might vary over time and with geographical origin. At later ages the test results correlate less with compressive strength values, this in contrast to results obtained when calcined clays were tested and heat release correlated well at all ages [22]. The test method, taken from Snellings and Scrivener (2016), that also adds Ca(OH)2 in excess, performed only slightly less well [20]. The similarity between the results indicate that Ca excess is crucial for the performance of the calorimetric test. Li et al. (2019) reported that longer calorimetric measurement times (3d, 7d) correlated well with 28 d compressive strength in a large variety of SCMs. In this study, however, measurement of these time steps was not attempted [19]. The R3-test showed a high sensibility to sample finesse. When the test was performed on samples ground to different finesses in the range of 2500 to 5000 cm2/g the reaction heat increased proportional to sample fineness (Fig. 5). Applying the regression equation shows that in our case heat release increases by about 4 J/g with every additional 100 cm2/g of fineness. This is a great advantage over chemical reactivity indices, as the important physical reactivity parameter \u2013 fineness, is included in the measurement. On the other hand, when differences due to sample compositions are to be assessed, one needs to take care to control for sample fineness. Superposing PSD curves (Fig. 3) of the 16 GGBS used in this study suggest that it is sufficient to apply the same grinding protocol to obtain similar PSD in a wide range of GGBS. However, during method validation the RSD between replicates increased to 1.59% when grinding was included in the procedure (Table 7). When only the calorimetric protocol was repeated, the RSD was 0.87%. This illustrates that the calorimetric protocol of the R3-test is repeatable and very sensitive even to slight changes in PSD. The calorimetric test proposed by Kasahni et al. (2014) did not correlate as well with compressive strength, in the set of 6 GGBS [29]. This is likely due to the absence of a supplementary Ca-source in this test. It still showed highest correlation with compressive strength at 2d (R2 = 0.67). Different heat curve shapes indicate that the reaction mechanisms differed between different samples. This led to different rankings of GGBS at different time steps. It is interesting to note the high performance of GGBS 13 in this test. In the other tests, GGBS 13 was the least reactive slag. This finding indicates, that different GGBS might show different reactivities in different activation systems. This means that a badly performing GGBS with one system might show higher reactivity with another activation system. The differences in heat development indicate that GGBS composition has an impact on reactivity also in purely alkali activated systems. This is in contrast to earlier studies by Ben Haha et al. (2011 and 2012), yet we do not provide data on compressive strength of alkali activated materials [40,50]. Calorimetric measurements over 7d, using the same clinker as the compressive strength test correlated less well with compressive strength results, than the formerly mentioned test at any time. It is especially interesting to note that also the 7d compressive strength results, corresponding to the duration of the calorimetric measurements, only showed weak correlation with released heat. 5.3 Microstructure of samples and reaction mechanisms during the R3 test XRD scans after the R3-test show similar phase assemblages in all samples. The detected phases are typically found in binders with high GGBS content, even though no cement was added [37]. However, Ca is supplied by portlandite excess and the concentrations of SO4 and K mainly come from the solution and are thus the same in all samples. There appears to be a systematic difference in ettringite and AFm phases close to kuzelite structure. The XRD scans from least reactive GGBS show no kuzelite peak, but a clearly distinguishable ettringite peak (Fig. 7). For more reactive GGBS an AFm peak close to kuzelite structure appears and its intensity overtakes that of ettringite for the most reactive samples. In GGBS 15, the most reactive GGBS, no ettringite is detected. It is likely that the higher Al content of the more reactive GGBS causes this shift, as a main difference between those minerals is the Al/Ca ratio, with kuzelite containing more Al with respect to Ca, than ettringite. This is consistent with former research showing that composition of hydrates can be modified by GGBS compositions and high Al contents are good for early age strength development of GGBS [37]. The early strength development due to higher Al contents is often associated with voluminous ettringite formation, this is not confirmed here [40,53]. Also, hydrotalcite appears to be more abundant in the most reactive samples. Liberation of MgO from the GGBS is essential for the formation of hydrotalcite like phases, and its formation lowers the uptake of Al in C-A-S-H phases [39,50]. In alkali activated GGBS presence of hydrotalcite led to higher long-term compressive strength due to reduced coarse pore volume [50]. Consequently, the formation of hydrotalcite appears to be a desirable feature also in blends adding OPC or portlandite. The importance of Al bearing hydrates for early age strength development might also be the reason for the sensitivity of the R3-test to early age reactivity. Formation of Al bearing phases is very exothermic, compared to the formation of C-S-H phases that are responsible for later age strength [54]. Ettringite for example has a formation enthalpy of −17,535 kJ/mol under standard conditions, whereas formation enthalpy of tobermorite is given with −1916 kJ/mol, almost ten times less [54]. It was argued that differences in hydration enthalpy are due to differences in the amount of water integrated to the crystal structure [55]. Ettringite and AFm phase take up more water to their structure than CSH phases and have higher molar volume [54,55]. The higher molar volume might explain their importance in early age strength as these phases can rapidly fill up pore space. The differences in formation enthalpies and molar volume could be the reason why the 7d calorimetric test does not correlate well with 7d compressive strength. At this age, strength development might not be controlled by the same phases that control heat release. A calorimetric test can only work when both coincide, which appears to be the case for early age, in blended cements that contain high proportions of GGBS. 6 Conclusion 1. Large difference in slag reactivity exist, those are mainly but not exclusively due to differences in GGBS composition. The influence is either due to dissolution rate of the glass or type and structure of hydrates formed. 2. Differences in 2d strength of blended cement pastes can be conveniently predicted by the R3 method. The method does not work as well for later ages. 3. The R3-test proved to be highly sensitive to differences in fineness. Higher reactive surface yield higher reaction heat at a rate of approximately 4 J/g per 100 cm2. This is a great advantage over reactivity indices. 4. Differences in compressive strength between GGBS in cements with high replacement rates are most pronounced at early age, most notably 2d in the studied systems. This is likely due to the importance of Al bearing phases for early age strength.

        "dc:description": "Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) is a glassy by-product of pig iron production and is commonly used in concrete industry to replace cement and thereby lower the carbon footprint of the material. Large variations in reactivity exist depending on the GGBS physical and chemical features. Here we investigate the ability of three rapid calorimetric methods to evaluate the reactivity of GGBS. On a set of 16 industrial GGBS, we show that 24 h heat release, using the R3-protocol, correlates well with 2d compressive strength of standard mortars using 75 wt% GGBS. The correlation of R3-test results (R2 = 0.87) is better than for traditional reactivity indices calculated from chemical composition. Furthermore, we present data on the repeatability of the test protocol and show that the R3-protocol is very sensitive to sample fineness. Finally, XRD patterns show that slight differences in phase assemblage exist between the most and least reactive GGBS.",
