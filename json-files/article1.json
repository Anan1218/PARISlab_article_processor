Centro de Investigación, Innovación y Desarrollo de Materiales \u2013 CIDEMAT Facultad de Ingeniería Universidad de Antioquia UdeA Calle 70 No. 52-21 Medellín Colombia This work studies the use of steel slag as a source of metallic oxides for the synthesis of chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPCs). Analysis of different slags revealed characteristics, relating to alkaline character, granulometry and metallic oxide content, which could enable their use other than as construction aggregates. Steel slags from an electric arc furnace (EAF) and basic oxygen furnace (BOF), as well as ladle furnace basic slag (LFS), were collected from steel plants in Colombia following the ASTM D75 standard practice for aggregate sampling. The slags were analysed through techniques such as SEM/EDS, FTIR, XRD and XRF, finding considerable quantities of CaO and iron oxides that provide the necessary metallic cation in acid-base reaction systems. The formation of phosphate ceramics was achieved from steel slags, compression strengths of up to 20 MPa were reached at 35 days and the chemical stability of the cements obtained was evaluated. Additionally, physical properties important to the formation of chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPCs), such as specific gravity, grain size and pH, were determined. Keywords Characterization Chemically bonded phosphate ceramics Steel slag Metallic oxides Mechanical properties 1 Introduction Chemically bonded ceramics (CBCs) are among the plethora of materials subject to chemical reaction. This group of new materials has been developed in recent decades, and has grown in importance. Chemically bonded ceramics are a group of materials that share characteristics with ceramics structured by sinterization with increased temperature, as well as conventional cements [1]. The chemically bonded ceramics group includes chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPCs). These are typically formed by a process known as an acid-base type reaction, which allows reactions combining metallic oxide cations with phosphate anions, producing water and salts. These reactions can take place in solutions under normal pressure and hydrothermal conditions [2,3]. Chemically bonded phosphate ceramics are also referred to as phosphate cements. Acid-base (AB) cements have been known of since the 19th century and are an alternative to polymerization for the formation of macromolecular materials. These cements are quick setting and some possess unusual properties such as adherence and translucency. Their applications range from biomedical to industrial [4]. The first AB cement, of zinc oxychloride, was reported by Sorel in 1855, and was used in dentistry without significant acknowledgment [4], Another form of AB cement, synthesized from zinc oxide and phosphoric acid, was developed at the turn of the 20th century. Difficulties were encountered in the formation of these cements, which led to research being focused on the reduction of the strong formation reactions, through calcination of the zinc oxide and the use of zinc hydroxide and aluminum to neutralize the phosphoric acid. These cements are currently used in dental restoration. The development of CBPC is linked to the discovery of zinc phosphate cements, which is the main reason for their significance [1]. The best-known phosphate compounds include magnesium phosphate ceramics, calcium phosphate, iron phosphate, zinc phosphate and aluminium phosphate. Magnesium phosphate ceramics have a particularly significant industrial impact, as they are currently sold under various trade names for applications in civil engineering. Similarly, bioceramics derived from magnesium phosphates are a new alternative biomaterial, due to the biological importance of magnesium ions in enzyme activation, and cellular growth and proliferation [5], Other useful biomaterials include the zinc phosphate cements mentioned above, and calcium phosphate cements, which have been investigated as bone replacements for some time. Due to environmental considerations of increasing importance worldwide, a lot of research has focused on the development of eco-efficient materials with minimum impact on the environment. At present there are significant efforts to find ways to reuse industrial waste, in order to reduce its environmental impact. Various studies on chemically bonded phosphate ceramics have had a positive influence in this respect. The Argonne National Laboratory in the USA synthesized a phosphate cement named \u201cferroceramicrete\u201d from red sludge, a waste product of aluminium production from bauxite. This process utilized the high content of iron oxide (hematite) present in red sludge. Partial quantities of this hematite were reduced in order for it to be subsequently activated with phosphoric acid, thereby obtaining cement suitable for use in the production of bricks, blocks and concrete for construction [6]. The development of ceramics using slag as a source of iron oxide has also been recorded. He et al. [7] developed an iron phosphate cement using copper slag rich in iron oxide (FeO) and an acid phosphate such as monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4), recording compression resistances of 44.78 MPa. Similarly, Choi et al. used BOF slag for the formation of iron phosphate ceramics, obtaining compression resistance in the order of 19 MPa [8]. These cements have been used in the immobilization of dangerous waste. Attempts have been made to use silicates from mining tailings and waste to obtain chemically bonded ceramics [9], although extracting the silicates from the mining tailings has proved challenging. In addition, it is important to highlight the synthesis of phosphate ceramics with good compression resistance from silicates such as wollastonite (CaSiO3) [10,11]. Meanwhile, Hou et al. bonded calcined carbon gangue as an active addition to magnesium phosphate (MPK) cements, modifying the setting time and mechanical properties of the cement. These results showed that calcined coal gangue extended the final setting time and improved the early strength of the cement [12]. Li et al. reported that the addition of Class F fly ash can improve water and salt resistance in magnesium phosphate cements without altering mechanical resistance [13]. Similarly, Wagh et al. proved that the addition of Class C and F fly ashes doubles or triples the compression resistance of phosphate cements. This increase can probably be explained by the additional reactions of the amorphous silica of the ashes with the acid phosphates [3]. The compatibility shown with fly ash and other types of industrial waste evidences the solidity in the formation of phosphates in the presence of impurities. This allows for variation in the raw materials [7] and, added to the fact that one of the areas with the greatest advances in research is the formation of phosphate cements in the presence of heavy and dangerous radioactive wastes [14], demonstrates that these waste particles do not prevent or limit the formation of chemically bonded phosphate ceramics. It is important to state that the large majority of phosphate ceramics are obtained from reactive grade compounds obtained commercially under a range of specifications [1]. However, a great opportunity exists to form phosphate ceramics from industrial wastes such as steel slag, which have a high content of precursor oxides for the acid-base reactions in phosphate ceramics [9,15,16]. Steel slag is a waste product of steel production, which is primarily carried out using electric arc furnaces (EAF), basic oxygen furnaces (BOF) or ladle furnaces (LFS). Black steel slag (electric arc furnace slag) is derived from primary metallurgy or scrap melting in electric arc furnaces [17]. White steel slag (ladle furnace basic slag) originates from molten liquid from electric arc furnaces, which is poured into a ladle furnace subject to constant stirring by argon gas, allowing the elimination of heavy metal oxides and desulphurization of the molten liquid. BOF slag is obtained via steel refinement in basic oxygen furnaces. In these, the liquid metal (pig iron) is introduced together with lime and dolomite into a basic oxygen converter, into which oxygen is pumped at high pressure in order to eliminate impurities such as silicon, manganese or phosphorus, since these combine with the calcium to form slag which can then be removed. Most steel slags are composed principally of CaO, MgO, SiO2 and FeO, the total concentration of these oxides being in the range of 88\u201392% [17]. For this reason, steel slag can be a rich source of oxides for the generation of chemically bonded ceramics with significant cementing properties and potential commercial viability. However, the concentration of these oxides and of the other secondary components varies between different batches of slag depending on the raw materials, furnace type and technology available, directly affecting the mechanical and cementing properties of the ceramics formed. Therefore, in the search for new materials derived from steel slag it is important to achieve accurate representation of the raw materials through normalized sampling methods, ensuring universalization of the components and the most detailed possible description of the raw materials, with the assistance of the engineering and materials science disciplines. The present work provides a state of the art study of the use of industrial waste to obtain chemically bonded phosphate ceramics, specifically using steel slag, a process rarely reported in the literature. The objective of this study is to describe and compare different types of Colombian steel slags that are potential precursors to chemically bonded phosphate ceramics, through analysis of their physical, chemical and mineralogical properties, as well to demonstrate the formation and description of phosphate ceramics using steel slags. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Conditioning of steel slags Four types of slag were analyzed: two EAFs, one BOF, and one FINE. These were provided by Colombian steel mills. The slag used in this study named EAF-1 come from a national steel producer while the EAF-2, BOF and FINE slags are from another steel producer. Both of the plants where the slags originate are located in the department of Boyacá in Colombia. The FINE slag is a mix of EAF, LFS and BOF slags, the last of these being the largest component. This slag is obtained as a final waste product after a process of magnetic separation. All the slags were subjected to a stabilization process with the addition of water, and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The slags were sampled in accordance with the ASTM D75M-14 and ASTM C702M-11 standards. To reduce its size, the slag was ground using jaw crushers, knee mills and ball mills of the following specifications: BRAUN CHIPMUNK primary jaw crusher with 7 cm entry opening, 3 cm discharge opening and 270 rpm speed, equipped with a motor of 1710 rpm speed, 1.5 Kw, and 60 Hz frequency; CONSOLIDATED STRUTEVANT MILL CO knee mill with maximum opening of 3.5 cm, minimum opening of 0.1 cm, equipped with a motor of 835 rpm, ½ H.P and 60 Hz frequency; SIEMENS SINAMICS ball mill with a frequency range of (0\u201360) Hz, loaded with spheres of 26 mm, 19 mm and 13 mm of diameter. 2.2 Physical analysis of steel slags The pH was determined via potentiometric procedure using a HANNA HI8424 digital pH meter with a BAECO BA17 glass electrode, calibrated with pH buffer solutions of 4.00, 7.00 and 10.00. 30 gr of each slag sample was placed in solution with 80 ml deionized water for one hour, and the solution was stirred before the measurements were taken. The apparent specific gravity, bulk specific gravity and absorption percentage were determined using 50 gr of saturated surface dry sample of each slag. These samples were weighed with an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo, UMX5 comparator) with 0.1 mg sensitivity. The volume was determined using 100 ml pycnometers. All assays were carried out according to the ASTM C-128 standard. Particle size distribution (granulometry) was carried out dry on each slag, according to standard ASTM C-136. 300 gr of sample of each slag was sieved in a PINZUAR brand sieve stirrer (ROT-TAP) of 1725 rpm, 1/3H.P and 60 Hz frequency, equipped with sieves No 4, 8, 14, 20, 35, 60, 100, 200 and 400, normalized according to ASTM E11-95. 2.3 Chemical and mineralogical analysis of slags Semiquantitive analysis of the oxides was achieved through X ray fluorescence spectrometry, carried out with Omnian mode standardless analysis, calculated by Epsilon. This was performed using slags manually crushed into power in a plastic holder, using an Epsilon 1 PANalytical device with excitation capacities ranging from 10 kV to 50 kV, silicon drift detector (SDD), 50 kV X ray tube generator and silver anode. In the percentages determined the loss on ignition (LOI) was considered. For the quantitative analysis of the oxides, 0.7 gr of each sample was prepared in duplicate. Loss on ignition tests were repeated until the weight was stabilized. A mix of lithium tetraborate and (Li2B4O7) and lithium metaborate (LiBO2) 66/33 was used as a fluxing agent, to obtain a disc in a platinum crucible at 1100 °C of the molten mass (pearly). This was analyzed by XRF spectrometry in a Thermo ARL Optim\u2019X WDXRF device. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed using a Shimadzu IRTracer-100 device with a scan range of 400\u20134000 cm−1. The analysis technique used was attenuated total reflectance (ATR), which was applied to all the slags. All the slag samples were analyzed by X ray diffraction (XRD) using an EMPYREAN diffractometer with Co source (Kα1 = 1.78 Å) (Kα2 = 1.79 Å). The X ray diffraction patterns were acquired in the interval 2θ (10.01\u201399.98°), with a minimum step size of 0.026°/s. The software High Score Plus was used to identify the minerals present in the samples via the Inorganic Crystal Structure Standard Database (ICSD) and Crystallography Open Database (COD). Similarly, the High Score Plus software was used for the quantitative analysis of the crystalline and amorphous fractions. This was performed using Reitveld refinement, using the internal standard method with additions of rutile (TiO2) of 20%. The parameters considered to validate the adjustment of the Rietveld refinement for each sample analyzed were as follows: R expected (Re), R profile (Rp), Weighted R profile (Rwp) and Goodness of Fit (GOF) [18]. Scanning electron microscope analysis was carried out using an SEM Jeol JSM-6490 LV device with acceleration voltage of 20fV, coupled to an EDS detector used to analyze the elemental chemical composition of the different slags through X ray energy dispersive spectroscopy. 2.4 CBPC development using steel slags Phosphate cements were prepared in duplicate from the EAF-1, EAF-2, BOF and FINE slags. The particle size was 150 μm and the liquid-solids ratio was maintained at 1: 1.5 for each sample. For this, 5gr of slag reacted with 7.5 ml of H3PO4 solution. The H3PO4 was dissolved in deionized water in concentrations of 60%. H3BO3was added in proportions of 1.5% by weight, as a retardant additive to the mixture. The mixing of the components was performed in polypropylene containers, in order subsequently to form cylindrical samples of 16 mm × 32 mm in PVC molds. These molds were cured in environmental laboratory conditions (T = 22 ± 2 °C and Hrelativa = 60 ± 5%) for 7 and 35 days. Compression resistance tests were performed on the prepared specimens according to the ASTM C 39 standard. The compression resistance tests were carried out in a SHIMADZU Autograph AGSX universal testing machine with loading capacity of 50 KN and loading speed of 0.25 MPa/s. Samples with the previous composition were also prepared in order to evaluate the chemical stability of the cements formed. Once the cements were cured, the samples were submerged in 500 ml of deionized water and 500 ml of Na2SO4 with concentration of 1 M. These were removed after 7 and 21 days (see Fig. 1 ), dried for 24 h at 60 °C, and subjected to compression tests in order to establish the effect of the immersion solutions on the mechanical properties of the cements. The pH of the water and the solution were analyzed at 0, 1, 7, and 21 days. The product of the leaching of the cements submerged in H2O and Na2SO4 solution was filtered and dehydrated for 24 h in order to evaluate its composition by XRF. Table 1 shows the basic conditions of the curing of the ceramics and the immersion tests to evaluate chemical stability. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physical properties The pH results found for the EAF1, EAF2, BOF and FINE slags are presented in Table 2 . The high alkalinity levels correspond mainly to the high CaO content reported for all the slags. The higher alkalinity in the BOF and FINE slags is a direct result of the higher CaO percentages in these slags, as will be discussed later. A fundamental aspect in the formation of chemically bonded ceramics is the basicity of metallic oxides which react with various acidic compounds to form consolidated ceramics [1]. Steel slags can act as a metallic cation source via metallic oxides, consolidating their role as the basic component in these chemical reaction systems [19]. The values for the relative densities of the slags show high similarity, although they are slightly greater for the EAF slags. These relative densities, presented in Table 2, are slightly higher the relevant value for Portland cement (3 g/cm3), indicating that the use of slags as a reactive material for the formation of chemically bonded ceramics would provide a physical load for the mix similar to or slightly higher than that of a conventional cement. The values recorded for bulk density were very similar for all four slags, which may be due to their mineral composition. This confirms the low absorption of the slags of around 1%, which directly contributes to their plasticity and porosity, and also guarantees adequate conditions for their use in a potential mix, since the quantity of water required for the mix would be minimal and so better control could be achieved of the proportions of the other raw materials. In Fig. 2 the appearance of the slags after the crushing and grinding process is shown. The data recorded for the particle size distribution of the slags is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3 , enabling their use as an aggregate to be considered. Granulometric analysis demonstrates similar grain size for these materials, showing that 60% of the particles of each slag studied present a size below 300 µm approximately, although a difference in particle size between 0.25 mm and 2.36 mm can be observed for the EAF1 slag in relation to the other particle sizes, this difference is not significant, while the shape of the size distribution curves of the particles shown in Fig. 3 varies in a narrow range, tending towards smaller sizes that correspond to a fine aggregate (ASTM D-75/D75M). Based on the uniformity and curvature coefficients obtained for the EAF1, EAF2, BOF and FINE slags, these samples are classified as poorly graded fine sands according to the USCS (United Soil Classification System). The reaction of the slags with the other components that results in chemically bonded ceramics requires relatively low grain size (fine sands) [1], making it necessary to crush and grind the slags to bring them to the desired particle size. 3.2 Morphological, chemical and mineralogical analysis of the steel slags 3.2.1 SEM/EDS, XRF The SEM analysis carried out on the slag samples is presented in Fig. 4 . This shows heterogenous morphology with a wide variety in particle size, between 0.1 µm and 100 µm. In general, particles with irregular and angular shape are observed, due to the crushing and grinding processes applied. Additionally, agglomeration is observed for the smallest particles [20], for the four slags analyzed. Table 3 shows the EDS results for the semiquantitive elemental composition of the slags, which in general identify Ca, O, Fe and Si as the elements in greatest proportion. This is corroborated by XRF results which show CaO, Fe2O3 and SiO2 as the predominant oxides. However, the results obtained from XRF for some oxides, for example Fe2O3, do not enable us to determine the corresponding type of iron oxide. However, this oxide can be present as FeO, Fe2O3 or Fe3O4. Table 4 shows significant quantities of CaO, Fe2O3, SiO2, MgO, Al2O3 and MnO. These oxides can participate in the formation of chemically bonded ceramics [1]. Divalent oxides such as CaO, MgO and MnO are the principal candidates for the formation of coherent ceramics. Meanwhile, trivalent oxides such as Fe2O3 y Al2O3 can also form CBPCs, but must be subjected to reduction or calcination processes at medium temperatures [15]. SiO2 has low solubility and therefore does not participate in the formation of ceramics serving instead as a filler, improving mechanical resistance and helping to reduce the setting time [1]. The different origins of the EAF slags is observed to be of little significance, given that they present very similar compositions. The FINE slag is a refinement of BOF slag, where a part the iron has been removed by a process of magnetic separation, as shown by XRF analysis. Meanwhile, the addition of LFS slag to FINE slag is demonstrated by EDS analysis, as the Si percentage is higher than in the BOF slag, Si being a very significant element in LFS slags [21,22]. The presence of certain elements such as Cr, Mn and P is due principally to the circumstances of the steel production. Electric arc furnaces, which produce EAF slags, are fed with scrap from various sources that contains a significant presence of alloyed metals such as Cr and Mn [17]. Also, percentages of P are found in the iron mineral that feeds the oxygen steel working process (basic oxygen convertor). Phosphorus is an inconvenient element in the composition of steel and so dephosphorization processes of the liquid pig iron are required, a characteristic determinant in the production of BOF type slags [23]. 3.2.2 FTIR The bands observed in the FTIR spectra in Fig. 5 present chemical composition of some similarity for all the slags. The bands for the EAF slags are very similar, while the BOF and FINE bands present differences to these. There are frequent peak overlaps that make identification of the bands difficult, but the results corroborate to a great extent those found by the SEM/EDS and XRF analyses. In general, the area from 1200 to 900 and 500 to 800 is identified as corresponding respectively to the deformation of the stretching and bending bands of Si-O [24]. This indicates the presence of silicates as the most abundant compounds in the slags, given that this is one of the most significant visual areas in the graphic. Specifically, bands at 1112 cm−1 and 993 cm−1 are observed, corresponding to the vibrations of the Si-O bond that are typical of silicates [25,26]. The asymmetric stretching vibration of Si-O at 970 cm−1, clearly visible for the EAF slags, indicates the presence of silicate chains [24]. The bands at 1112 cm−1 and 847 cm−1 relating to the bending vibration of SiO4−-4 associated with dicalcium silicate β (Ca2SiO4) larnite, are visible for the EAF slags, and may form shoulders in the BOF and FINE slags [27,25]. The bands at 1012 cm−1 and 1051 cm−1 present for the BOF and FINE slags are assigned to the P-O stretching modes [28\u201330], corresponding to the typical phosphates for these types of slag. The band at 584 cm−1 is associated with the (Fe-O) vibration of magnetite [25], observable for the EAF slags. The band present at 1478 cm−1 corresponds to the (MgO) vibration visible for the EAF slags. The band at 712 cm−1 visible for all four slags corresponds to the CO3 2− ion of calcite [31,32], which is likely to be present in very low proportions in all the slags. The wide band at 1418 cm−1 relates to the metallic stretching of the Fe-Ca bond which, together with the band at 875 cm−1, indicates the stretching of the Fe-O bond [33]. This demonstrates the presence of calcium ferrites, possibly brownmillerite (Ca2FeAlO5) or srebrodolskite (Ca2Fe2O5), in the greatest proportion for the BOF and FINA slags. The bands present in the range from 450 cm−1 to 650 cm−1 are commonly associated with simple metallic oxides, but due to the complexity in the composition of the slags, interpretation of the results in this area is difficult. 3.2.3 XRD Steel slags present a vitreous phase which is produced from the cooling of the slags with water. In the present analysis, the vitreous phase was considered and quantified through Rietveld refinement with the addition of internal standard (TiO2). XRD analysis shows a crystalline phase corresponding to approximately 40% of the total weight in all the slags, with a mineralogical phase largely corroborated through the chemical composition observed by FTIR. Moreover, values of around 60% by weight corresponding to the amorphous phase are observed for all the slags. In Fig. 6 , the mineralogical composition of the steel slags, according to the COD and ICSD databases, are presented in percentage values by weight, quantified through Rietveld, Table 5 . The adjustment criteria of the Rietveld refinement calculated from the residual values (Re, Rp, Rwp, and GOF), which quantify the difference between the experimental and calculated profiles, are shown in Table 6 . The statistical values for Rp, and Rwp, are considered acceptable when under 10%. Re evaluates the quality of the data and, theoretically, (Rwp) can never be better than (Re) [34]. GOF compares (Rwp) y (Re), and a perfect refinement for GOF would present values close to 1. However, in practice, values lower than 5 represent an optimum refinement [35]. In general, the composition of the slags can be defined through the silicates and iron oxides shown in Table 5. The chemical composition of the EAF slags is very similar, regardless of the steel mill that they originate from. In these slags, it is observed that silicates predominate over iron oxide, and the participation of dicalcium silicate β with a crystalline formation similar to larnite (Ca2SiO4) is significant. Formation of alite (Ca3SiO5), present in some slags subject to rapid cooling, is not observed, confirming the slow cooling process for this type of slag [36]. Iron oxides are principally represented by wuestite (FeO) and magnetite (Fe3O4), while appearing lower proportions in crystalline combinations such as brownmillerite (Ca2FeAlO5) and srebrodolskite (Ca2Fe2O5). Additionally, there is a compositional participation of chromium oxide and manganese in spinel form (FeO·MnO·MgO) Cr2O3. The content of free lime and free magnesia is practically negligible in the composition of EAF steel slags. The BOF and FINE slags present similar composition to one another and show significant differences to EAF slags. Iron oxides are distributed in the BOF and FINE slags, principally in wuestite and forming compounds in dicalcium ferrites such as brownmillerite and srebrodolskite. The results of the XRF, SEM/EDS and FTIR analyses demonstrate the presence of phosphate, which is also evidenced by XRD analysis through the formation of silicates with phosphate contents in their structure. Various authors explain the presence of phosphate as an impurity or forming a solid solution which establishes itself in the form of dicalcium silicates or silicocarnatite [37,36]. Another important difference is the presence of manganese oxides, alone or in combination with iron in the form of ferromanganese oxide. In general, very low content of free lime is observed, since most of this is combined in the form of silicates or with iron oxide to form calcium ferrites, due to the high temperatures in the order of 1600 °C required to melt steel. The FINE slag show the highest content of free lime, which can be explained by the significant presence of CaO in slags from ladle furnaces (LFS) [21]. Many of the phases described through XRD have also been identified in previous studies, corroborating the findings in this study [38\u201340]. The chemical and mineralogical analyses are consistent with the SEM/EDS, XRF, FTIR and XRD results, showing good availability of metallic oxides as possible precursor compounds to chemically bonded phosphates. Steel slags contribute mainly to the formation of calcium phosphate, iron phosphate and manganese phosphate cements. Due to the complex and varied chemical composition of steel slags, it is considered that these contribute to the formation of multiple phases or multiphase cements in the following way: Dicalcium silicates possibly contribute to the formation of cements with significant calcium phosphate phases in all the slags, and compounds like brownmillerite or srebrodolskite, wuestite and magnetite can help in the formation of iron phosphate cements [1]. Manganese oxides can form manganese oxide phases with additional temperature or reduction treatment. Equally, it is important to highlight that BOF and FINE slags can, as a result of their high CaO content, generate cements with very rapid setting time due to the rapid dissolution reactions that this oxide presents, negatively affecting the workability of the cement formed [41]. 3.2.4 Amorphous Due to the high amorphous content shown by XRD in the slags, it is important to specify their content. For this, XRF data corresponding to the quantitative elemental composition of the slags by oxide weight, and XRD data on the crystalline phases quantified through Rietveld were used. The determination of the amorphous oxide content consisted in subtracting the oxide weight determined through XRD from the total oxide content of the slags obtained through XRD [42]. A mass balance was used to estimate the amorphous content and to determine which compounds could exist within it. In Table 7 , the approximate composition of the amorphous components of CaO, Fe2O3 and SiO2 is calculated. These results are a first approximation, since it should be considered that while the calculations performed under the assumption that the detected phases have an ideal composition, the phases in solid solution, such as those described above, can generate imprecision, and in addition the minority phases have been ignored. 3.3 Chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPC) From the reaction of H3PO4 and the steel slags, the formation of coherent ceramics is shown. These ceramics are principally formed through the reaction of the base component (steel slags) with the acid component (aqueous solution of H3PO4). The cements formed with EAF1, EAF2, BOF and FINE are referred to as, C-EAF1, C-EAF2, C-BOF and C-FINE, respectively. 3.3.1 Morphological and chemical analysis of the cements formed The SEM image in Fig. 7 shows the principal phases present in the cements formed from the steel slags after they were subjected to compression, prior to immersion tests. In general, two clearly distinguishable phases are observed in the SEM images: one crystalline phase with formations with ordered tendency, in external laminate shape, and an amorphous vitreous phase which describes the cement matrix. From the EDS corresponding to the micrographs (Fig. 8 ), Ca, Fe and P are observed as the principal elements in greater proportion, suggesting a probable composition of calcium phosphates and iron phosphates. The crystalline phase is associated principally with calcium phosphates formed through the reaction of calcium silicates and phosphoric aqueous solution [43,10], The amorphous phase corresponds to an iron phosphate, originating from the iron oxides present principally in the Wuestite, dicalcium ferrites in reaction with phosphoric acid solution, a compound already identified by Wagh and Singh for iron phosphate cements, known as vitrocrystalline ceramics [1,44]. Fig. 9 shows the diffractogram of the cements formed from steel slags analyzed. Two calcium phosphate compounds corresponding to the crystalline phases that are present in the four cements are mainly identified: Calcium Dihidrogenophosphate Hydrate Ca(H2PO4)2·xH2O and Brushite CaHPO4·2H2O, confirming the described previously in SEM/EDS. The figure also shows a greater Brushite phase formation for C-BOF and C-FINE, possibly explained by the higher content of CaO present in the BOF and FINE slag composition, In addition to a considerable formation of calcium dihydrogen phosphate hydrate for C-EAF. Likewise, an amorphous phase is present, which is not identified in DRX, which can be associated mainly with iron phosphates as mentioned above and residues of amorphous raw material that did not participate in the chemical reaction of cement. 3.3.2 Compression resistance In Fig. 10 the mechanical behavior of the cements formed from steel slags prior to immersion in H2O y Na2SO4, is observed. Compression resistances for the four compositions of between 5 and 20 Mpa are observed. With regard to the development of the early compression resistances (7 days), with the exception of C-EAF1, all show similar resistances at 7 and 35 days. The reactions of quick setting and early high resistance are associated with behavior typical to phosphate cements [45\u201347]. Greater compression resistances are observed in the C-BOF and C-FINE cements (15\u201320 Mpa). This is possibly associated with the greater percentages of calcium oxide (CaO) present in their composition, which forms phosphate cement phases associated with greater mechanical resistance [48,49]. 3.3.3 Chemical stability Some studies have recorded poor chemical resistance on the part of phosphate cements, specifically in the case of magnesium phosphates. The authors describe how their compression resistance diminishes when they are immersed in water or subjected to a humid environment [50,51], affecting their mechanical properties. Also, it has been described how these cements are affected by components which have not reacted and are highly soluble in water, generating pores which affect the morphology of the cements and reduce their mechanical resistance [45]. Therefore, the compression resistance of the different compositions after immersion of the samples in H2O and Na2SO4, was evaluated. In this process, degradation of the test tubes was observed, as well as leaching products in the samples (Fig. 1), associated primarily with Fe, Ca and P, registered via XRD analysis (Table 8 ). This indicates the degradation of calcium phosphates and iron phosphates as possible principal phases in the ceramics formed. The attack of sulphates on the surface is evident, producing efflorescence and slight expansion on the samples in Na2SO4 solution (Fig. 11 ). In Fig. 12 a, reduction in resistance for the cements of the samples immersed in H2O for 7 days in the order of 68% to 77% is observed, with a slight increase in resistance at 21 days. For samples immersed in Na2SO4, resistance is reduced between 65% and 85%, with an increase in resistance at 21 days (Fig. 12b). The mechanical resistances decreases substantially, principally affecting the samples immersed in H2O and the C-EAFs. In general, the cements show a similar behavior for the samples immersed in H2O, however, for the samples immersed in Na2SO4a greater deterioration is observed in the C-EAFs than the C-BOF and C-FINE. The reduction in resistance associated with the C-SLAG is principally due to the leaching of the constituent elements, as can be observed in the XRF analysis of the leaching products (Table 8). This could be associated with the loss of resistance to water penetration, related with a structure of low density and high porosity. It is also important to highlight the small volume of the test tubes immersed in water, which have a greater area of exposure to leaching and sulphate attack. Moreover, consistently with the XRD results, the presence of free lime (f \u2013CaO) is common, in the order of 0.5% to 2.2%, which favors the hydration of f \u2013CaO, causing an increase in volume and, in turn, an increase in the internal pressure and therefore damage to the structure [52]. Equally, possible carbonation cannot be ruled out, the high quantities of Ca in the composition and the alkaline environment of the slags can favor the capture of CO2, causing modification to the chemistry of the cement and, and possibly explain the slight increase in compression resistance at 21 days immersion in H2O or Na2SO4 solution [53]. In Portland cement mixtures which incorporate steel slags as aggregate, it has been recorded how these can affect the workability of conventional cements [52,53], Similarly, cements synthesized from slags and H3PO4 solutions present low workability, attributed to the angular shape of the slag particles, which reduces the flow of the mixture [54], in turn resulting in the reduction of mechanical resistance since good distribution of the particles in the mold is not enabled. The release of dangerous metals by leaching in steel slags can cause environmental problems and be a potential risk to human health. Signs of dangerous elements in steel slags such as Cadmium, Chrome, Mercury and Lead have been reported in various publications. However, recently, a study has been published on the leaching of dangerous metals in slags, in which steel slags were ruled out as a dangerous waste product, as none of the elements cited exceeded the concentration limits of the tests forming part of the TLCP (Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure) [55]. The levels of Chrome in steel slags reported in this study and quantified by XRF are around those referenced in the literature [56] and do not exceed 1 wt%. 4 Conclusions The alkalinity, relative density and granulometry of the analyzed slags were adjusted to parameters rendering them suitable for use as precursors of ceramic phosphates. The chemical, morphological and mineralogical analyses describe compounds potentially suitable for the synthesis of chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPC). The principal mineral phases present in all the analyzed slags were: wuestite, dicalcium silicate, srebrodolskite and brownmillerite, all of which are rich in calcium oxide and iron oxide, which can provide the metallic cation necessary for acid-base system reactions. In general, it is considered that the four slags analyzed can form phosphate cements. The EAF slags, with significant content of iron oxide and CaO, can contribute principally to the formation of iron phosphate cements and secondary phases of calcium phosphates. The calcium oxide (CaO) content found in the BOF and FINE slags may allow the formation of calcium phosphates, or at least constitute one of the principal phases in the formation of a chemically bonded phosphate ceramic (CBPC). However, the rapid dissolution reactions shown by CaO at certain pHs can make the formation of coherent ceramics difficult, especially for slags like BOF and FINE which have high CaO content. A good percentage of oxides that form phases with other elements is found for the analyzed slags. These minerals, which dissolve with difficulty to provide the metallic cation, form compounds that do not react and may participate as fillers in the recently formed cements, together with other minerals corresponding to the gangue. Early compression strengths (7 days) are common for the four types of cements formulated with ranges between 6 and 16 MPa, in addition to compression strengths (35 days) of up to 20 MPa for C-FINE. The diverse chemical composition present in the steel slags with significant percentages of compounds susceptible to the formation of CBPCs makes it necessary to consider the application of adequate methods for the treatment or use of this material. Steel slags considered as industrial waste have a wide potential for use as components in chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPCs).

        "dc:description": "This work studies the use of steel slag as a source of metallic oxides for the synthesis of chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPCs). Analysis of different slags revealed characteristics, relating to alkaline character, granulometry and metallic oxide content, which could enable their use other than as construction aggregates. Steel slags from an electric arc furnace (EAF) and basic oxygen furnace (BOF), as well as ladle furnace basic slag (LFS), were collected from steel plants in Colombia following the ASTM D75 standard practice for aggregate sampling. The slags were analysed through techniques such as SEM/EDS, FTIR, XRD and XRF, finding considerable quantities of CaO and iron oxides that provide the necessary metallic cation in acid-base reaction systems. The formation of phosphate ceramics was achieved from steel slags, compression strengths of up to 20 MPa were reached at 35 days and the chemical stability of the cements obtained was evaluated. Additionally, physical properties important to the formation of chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPCs), such as specific gravity, grain size and pH, were determined.",
