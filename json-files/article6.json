A new amorphous phase mix design framework had been successfully developed in consideration of calcium content through the combination of ground-granular blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) in fly ash (FA) blended geopolymers. The new framework has been developed considering the amorphous silicon, aluminium, sodium and calcium containing phases of the aluminosilicate sources to increase geopolymerisation reactivity and compressive strength. By utilising this new framework, this study found that the optimal amorphous Si/Al ratio of FA- and GGBFS-blended geopolymers are between 2.3 and 3.1. At 40\u201350% of FA replacement with GGBFS, it had been observed that blended geopolymers are able to achieve the majority of its 28\u202fdays compressive strength at 7\u202fdays. To account for the effect of calcium content, a new amorphous ratio, (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al, is proposed, with an optimal ratio of between 3.2 and 3.4. Keywords Fly ash Ground-granular blast furnace slag Geopolymer Amorphous material X-ray diffraction 1 Introduction It has been established that geopolymers have the tremendous potential to reduce the greenhouse gas emission of the concrete industry [1] and offer superior engineering performance over conventional Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) [2\u20135]. Yet there is still limited application of geopolymer materials within the construction industry. This is partly due to the elevated temperature curing of fly-ash (FA)-based geopolymers and performance inconsistency issues of geopolymers. The alkaline activation of FA geopolymer mainly consists of sodium aluminosilicate hydrate (N-A-S-H), which is responsible for the provision of mechanical strength, with traces of zeolite from secondary reactions [6,7]. However, the formation of N-A-S-H is slow, especially under ambient conditions, making FA-based geopolymers unsuitable for in situ casting in industry. The ability to set under ambient condition can be achieved through the addition of calcium, using additives such as GGBFS, lime or hylime. The ability to set under ambient conditions is due to the formation of alumina-substituted calcium silicate hydrate (C-A-S-H) and calcium-(sodium) aluminosilicate hydrate (C-(N)-A-S-H), which allows rapid hardening and increase the rate of geopolymerisation [8\u201310]. GGBFS was chosen as a calcium additive for this study since it is more cost-effective [11]. The low amount of N-A-S-H formed by alkali activation of FA in the blended FA and GGBFS systems also eventually evolve into C-(N)-A-S-H and, finally, C-A-S-H in later stages [12,13]. However, this is dependent on the pH of the system, the availability of calcium, and the rate of dissolution of aluminosilicate materials. In addition to the ambient setting of geopolymers, the benefits of a blended FA and GGBFS geopolymer would be the simultaneous formation of a geopolymeric gel, with the presence of calcium helping bridge the gaps between different hydrated phases and inert particles, resulting in a more compact microstructure [14]. Therefore, an FA and GGBFS blended geopolymer may increase the adoption of geopolymers in the industry due to its ambient setting capabilities, which are more suitable for in situ applications, while maintaining the required performance. Aluminosilicate sources, such as FA and GGBFS, are heterogeneous materials with enormous variability in their chemical composition and morphology, in particularly fineness, which has precluded replicable results and leads to performance inconsistency in geopolymer production. The effect of aluminosilicate sources physical properties in geopolymer production has been found to have profound impact as physical properties such as fineess is known to improve leeching behaviour and produced high strength geopolymer [15\u201318]. However, the influence of chemical composition of the aluminosilicate sources are still less investigated as it was found that the geopolymers designed with amorphous approach have higher compressive strength in comparison to samples designed with conventional bulk mix designs [19,20]. Additionally, heterogeneous aluminosilicate sources, such as GGBFS and FA, consist of crystalline and amorphous phases [21]. The amorphous phases are highly reactive compared to the largely inert crystalline phases \u2013 react with alkaline activators to form geopolymer binders, with the crystalline phases, which don\u2019t participate in geopolymerisation, functioning as a filler in the geopolymer matrix [22,23]. In order to reduce the effect of the variability of different FA feedstocks, studies have investigated the effect of amorphous content in aluminosilicate sources [19,22,24,25]. Williams and van Riessen [19] formulated a systematic approach to mix design in order to control the physical properties of the geopolymer paste, which utilises amorphous compositional ratios obtained from a combination of Quantitative X-ray diffraction (Q-XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). There are also recent studies that adopt this novel mix design method to produce geopolymers from Bayer red mud [11], red-clay ceramic powders [26], and boiler ash [27]. Shekhovtsova et al had considered the impact of amorphous composition, fineness and reactivity, however, the addition of calcium content is not incorporated in the model [28]. However, the limitation of the amorphous based mixture design tool is it had been developed for one aluminosilicate material, such as FA or metakaolin, without the addition of calcium. There is limited research on GGBFS addition within the binder via amorphous mix design and its impact on the compressive strength of geopolymer mortar. Hence, the primary focus of this study was to expand the mathematical approach developed by Williams and van Riessen to investigate blended geopolymer mortars and the effect of calcium content to the binder. 2 Experimental investigation 2.1 Materials FA was sourced from the Eraring and Gladstone coal power plants in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Both FA feedstocks are classified as Class F in accordance with ASTM C618, as the calcium content is below 10%. Specific gravity of the Eraring and Gladstone FA are 2.1 and 2.35. Commercially available GGBFS from BGC Cement was used as a primary calcium and secondary aluminosilicate source within the geopolymer mortar mixtures. The specific gravity of the GGBFS is 3.0. The mixture proportions were based on a previous study [29]. All geopolymer mortar specimens consisted of natural sand with a nominal maximum size of 1.18\u202fmm. 2.2 Alkali activators A mixture of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets and sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) solution was used in the activating solution. The sodium hydroxide (97\u201398% purity) pellets were dissolved in water to produce 8\u202fM aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The D-grade sodium silicate, with a weight ratio of silicon dioxide to sodium oxide of 2.0, was also used as an activator. The concentration of the alkaline solutions and the molar ratio of the sodium silicate solutions were maintained to be constant throughout the experimental work. 2.3 Determination of amorphous phase of FA/GGBFS 2.3.1 Determination of the bulk oxide and crystalline composition The bulk composition of aluminosilicate, GGBFS and FA feedstocks, as oxides, was determined by XRF with a Bruker-AXS S4 Pioneer spectrometer. Q-XRD was used to evaluate the portion of crystalline and amorphous phases in the aluminosilicate materials. Data were collected using a Bruker-AXS D8 Discover powder diffractometer was used for the Q-XRD scans, with 0.3\u202fg of corundum (Al2O3) added as the internal standard with 3.0\u202fg of the aluminosilicate sample. The phases were searched using EVA 11.0 and the ICDD PDF4+ database and quantitative phase analysis Rietveld [30] full-pattern analyses were performed using TOPAS [31]. The relative Rietveld weight fraction was converted to absolute values by the internal standard method [32]. 2.3.2 Determination of amorphous composition The different phases and elemental oxides need to be broken down according to their stoichiometric compositions on an absolute basis so that the amorphous elemental composition can be determined [21,33]. The crystalline phase elemental composition was subtracted from the bulk oxide composition to obtain the amorphous elemental composition of the FA and GGBFS [19,22]. 2.4 Amorphous mix design formulation for fly-Ash/GGBS based geopolymer The mathematical formulation derived by Williams and van Riessen [19] was adapted and expanded to take account of the addition of calcium from GGBFS. The new mathematical formulation, as shown in Eq. (1), was used to calculate the weight of each constituent in a geopolymer mixture based on the amorphous weight fraction of the constituents. The main constituents of the mixture in this study are FA, sodium silicate (Na2Si2O5), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), water (H2O), and GGBFS. To account for the GGBFS addition in the mathematical formulation, the GGBFS component weight proportion is introduced in W, with calcium added to F and R. W denotes the weight percentages of each feedstock. F is the amorphous content of each raw material in mol/g of the element with FA as F1, sodium silicate as F2, sodium hydroxide as F3, water as F4 (represented as H in F matrix) and GGBFS as F5. R is the desired amorphous elemental mols which is used to calculate molar ratios as shown in Table 1 . The amorphous Si/Al, Ca/Si, Na/Al, and H/Si ratios were calculated using the results from Eq. (1), as shown below. Eq. (1) can be rewritten as Eq. (2) to calculate the required weight fractions for geopolymer mix design given the desired amorphous ratios.

(2) W = ( F T F ) - 1 F T R In this study, to investigate the range of amorphous ratios shown in Table 1, GGBFS was varied from 10% to 50% of the total binder content, with the balance made of FA. The letters \u201cE\u201d and \u201cG\u201d denote samples made with Eraring and Gladstone FA, respectively. 2.5 Sample Preparation, mixing and curing The fine aggregates were heated to 105\u202f°C for 24\u202fh to remove the water content from the sand grains, and cooled to room temperature before mixing. Mixing was carried out in a 10\u202fL Hobart mixer. The aluminosilicate material, either Eraring or Gladstone FA, GGBFS, and fine aggregate were first mixed for a period of 4\u202fmin, followed by mixing with the alkaline activator for a further 5\u202fmin. The geopolymer was poured into 50\u202fmm\u202f×\u202f50\u202fmm\u202f×\u202f50\u202fmm moulds, with a total of 18 cubes cast of each mix for the compressive strength tests. The specimens were compacted using a vibrating table. The mortar specimens were cured in controlled ambient conditions at (23\u202f±\u202f2)\u202f°C at 50% relative humidity. The specimens were demoulded 24\u202fh after casting. 2.6 Workability observations Flow table test was conducted to ASTM C230/C230M \u2013 14 to observe the spread of the geopolymer mortar after the mortar is activated with the alkaline solution [28]. The flow of the mortar is kept at 200\u202fmm (±10\u202fmm) spread to ensure the consistency in workability of each mix with small amounts of additional water. 2.7 Compressive strength testing The unconfined compressive strength was determined using an INSTRON 5500R Universal Testing Machine (UTM), with up to six specimens from each mix tested at 3, 7 and 28\u202fdays of curing. The compressive test was conducted in accordance with Australian Standard 1012.9 [34]. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Bulk oxide composition The bulk oxide composition of the Gladstone and Eraring FAs and the GGBFS are given in Table 2 . The Gladstone and Eraring FAs used in this study fulfil the Class F classification in accordance to ASTM C618 [35]. The GGBFS feedstock has a higher calcium content (44.2%) due to the addition of gypsum during the grinding process in the production of GGBFS in order to regulate the setting time of OPC [10,36]. 3.2 Crystalline composition The crystalline phases of the FA and GGBFS are given in Table 3 . Quartz and mullite were found in both Gladstone and Eraring FA, while iron oxide phases, such as hematite and magnetite, were present only in the Gladstone FA. Only two crystalline phases, quartz and gypsum, were found in the GGBFS. 3.3 Amorphous elemental composition The amorphous elemental composition of FA and GGBFS are given in Table 4 . The total amorphous content of the FA and GGBFS is 62\u201368 and 88\u202fwt%, respectively; comparable to that found in other studies [19,37\u201339]. Only the amorphous content of Si, Al, Ca and Na content of the amorphous phases in the aluminosilicate materials are considered in Eq. (1). Despite Eraring and Gladstone FAs being classified as Class F Fly Ash in accordance with ASTM C618, the compressive strength shown in Table 5 indicate that the geopolymers which utilised Gladstone FA generally had a higher compressive strength throughout all mixtures and curing periods. Even though the Gladstone FA has less amorphous content than the Eraring FA, the geopolymers which utilised Gladstone FA typically achieved a better compressive strength capacity over Eraring-based mixtures. This could be because the starting amorphous ratio of the FA feedstock has the potential to contribute to the difference in compressive strength between Eraring- and Gladstone-based geopolymers. Geopolymers produced with Eraring sourced FA had consistently higher silica content than the mixtures with Gladstone sourced FA. The Gladstone FA amorphous Si/Al is 2.1 while the Eraring FA is 3.8. The amorphous Si/Al ratio of Gladstone is closer to the optimal value of ∼2.5 as proposed by Rowles and O'Connor [40]. 3.4 Effect of varying GGBFS content on compressive strength development The compressive strengths of the cast geopolymers were found to be directly proportional to the GGBFS content, most likely due to the addition of calcium content to the mortar. The increase in compressive strength can be explained by (i) an increase in compactness, and (ii) the presence of C-(N)-A-S-H and C-A-S-H bonding. The addition of another aluminosilicate material such as GGBFS leads to a reduction in porosity and an increase in density of the geopolymer matrix where it is known that the mean particle size of GGBFS is relatively smaller than the FA [41,42]. Therefore, the relatively smaller, non-spherical GGBFS particles are expected to fill the voids between the FA particles, densifying the geopolymer matrix. The presence of C-(N)-A-S-H and C-A-S-H produces a more compact structure compared to N-A-S-H-dominated systems, as the simultaneous formation of geopolymeric gel and calcium-based bonding may help bridge the gaps between different hydrated phases and inert particles [14,43]. Due to the addition of calcium via the GGBFS within the FA-based geopolymer mortars, the resultant calcium-based bonding, such as C-A-S-H and C-(N)-A-S-H, contributes to the early-age compressive strength. The effect of calcium on early-age strength can be observed with the increasing compressive strength of the mortar specimens at 3 to 7\u202fdays curing within Figs. 1a and 2a . High-calcium specimens, such as M4E, M4G, M5E, and M5G, consist of larger proportions of GGBFS content (40 to 50%), and achieved the majority of their compressive strength by the 7-day curing mark; up to 90% of its total strength at 28-days strength. Also, it is observed that the highest compressive strength of Gladstone and Eraring-based sample is achieved with 50% GGBFS content with Si/Al ratio of 2.3 and 3.1, respectively (Figs. 1b and 2b ). Based on the FA feedstocks in this study, the optimum Si/Al ratio is found to be 2.3 with 69\u202fMPa compressive at 28\u202fdays for Gladstone-based mortars. However, specimens with low GGBFS content within the binder, such as M1E and M1G (10% GGBFS) only attained 50% of the 28\u202fdays compressive strength at 7\u202fdays. This is in agreement with the works of Nath and Sarker [44] and Deb et al. [41] which found the addition of GGBFS within FA-based geopolymer mortars contributed significant early age compressive strength with the formation of the C-A-S-H bonding [41,44]. The higher amount of calcium in the geopolymer mix enables ambient setting due to C-A-S-H forming more readily under ambient conditions compared to N-A-S-H-based systems. It is interesting to note that the increased GGBFS content within the binder in this study generally resulted in increasing variation of compressive strength, manifesting as an increasing 95% confidence interval, which caused higher GGBFS content mixture such as M4E to have the highest variation of compressive strength as seen in Table 5. The lowest variation of compressive strength can be observed with the M1E and M1G sample in this study. This may suggest the higher proportion of C-A-S-H bonding and the higher addition of GGBFS in the geopolymer matrix could contribute to the higher variation of compressive strength. Such variation must be taken into account when designing structures with GGBFS-containing geopolymer mortars. 3.5 Effect of calcium content on amorphous ratios In this study, compressive strength data in Fig. 3 shows that the highest compressive strength can be achieved with a Si/Al ratio of 2.3. This outcome is expected, as the compressive strength at early age curing (3-days) would be dependent upon the early age formation of C-A-S-H bonds, whereas the high compressive strength at 28-days could correlate to the compactness of the microstructure with the increasing addition of GGBFS. It is also known that a hybrid mixture of C-(N)-A-S-H and C-A-S-H bonds also contributes to a dense matrix with a lower porosity, which improves the compressive strength of blended geopolymers at higher GGBFS compositions [45]. The samples produced with Gladstone and Eraring FA shows an increase in compressive strength when the Si/Al ratio is approaching 2.3 to 3.0 which indicates there could be an optimal Si/Al inflection point between both values. For the Gladstone-based samples, it is observed that Gladstone FA is more receptive to the addition of calcium compared to Eraring FA, as a steep increase in compressive strength is found with higher GGBFS weight composition. Hence, it can be concluded that the calcium content is found to be more significant in comparison to Si/Al ratio in this study. It is anticipated that there would be a turning point, which would signify the optimal compressive strength outcome for a specific ratio of Si/Al. Komlijenovic [23] and Ozer and Soyer-Uzun [46] have reported that an increase in the bulk Si/Al ratio produces geopolymers of higher compressive strength. However, the compressive strength of the mortars in this study was observed to decline when the Si/Al ratio exceeds 3.1 while maximum compressive strength is obtained at 2.26 with M5G. This is consistent with Shekhovtsova et al as they observed high compressive is obtained with Si/Al amorphous ratio around 2.18 to 2.6 [38]. Lee et al. also reported compressive strength decline at high amorphous Si/Al ratio of 4.0 in their study, they reported the maximum compressive strength at amorphous Si/Al ratio of 3.5 with their FA feedstock [24]. Meanwhile, Williams and Van Reissen had found that high amorphous Si/Al ratio of 4.5 to be able to produce geopolymer with high compressive strength which contrasts the findings in this study as high Si/Al amorphous had been found to have lower compressive strength [19]. It is important to distinguish the difference in amorphous and bulk elemental ratio, as amorphous ratio only considers the reactive components of the aluminosilicate material in geopolymerisation while bulk ratio assumes the entire material to be reactive which not the case with FA and GGBFS [47]. Although the aluminium content of the aluminosilicate material is dependent upon the aluminosilicate material, the Eraring-based geopolymer mortars in this study were observed to be capable of achieving high compressive strength with the addition of GGBFS, despite the Eraring FA having less aluminium relative to the Gladstone FA. This would likely indicate that the Na/Al ratio has less influence on the compressive strength of the geopolymer mortar in comparison to solely FA-based geopolymers. This is in contrast to Sweeney et al\u2019s work with the Gladstone based FA geopolymers, which reported 50% higher compressive strength than Eraring based geopolymers [48], which highlights the importance of mix design in the formulation of geopolymer mortars. It is also known that sodium does not take precedence over calcium in geopolymerisation, which suggests that the presence of calcium would reduce the formation of N-A-S-H by the formation of C-A-S-H [13,14]. This can be explained with the higher proportion of the amorphous phases of GGBFS tend to be dissolved to form geopolymer binder compared to fly ash at ambient temperature as GGBFS has lower activation energy requirement for alkali activation compared to FA [47]. With the presence of sodium and calcium in the geopolymer mortars in this study, this suggests that the consideration of solely sodium in Na/Al ratio is insufficient, as both cations have a profound influence on the formation of the geopolymer binders. Therefore, a new amorphous ratio, (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al, is proposed to take account of the charge balancing of both cations in geopolymerisation of N-(C)-A-S-H or C-A-S-H. Table 6 shows the calculated (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al ratios from the values in Table 6. Based on the specimens cast in this study, a general trend had been observed in Fig. 4 , where the increase of (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al ratio leads to the increase of the compressive strength of the geopolymer specimens. The optimal (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al ratio is observed to range from approximately 3.21 to at least 3.40, with both Gladstone- and Eraring-based geopolymer mortars achieving highest compressive strengths of over 60\u202fMPa. The (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al ratios reported in this study are significantly higher than the optimum Na/Al ratios reported by Rowles and O\u2019Connor [40] where the optimum amorphous Na/Al ratio at 1.25 for metakaolin based geopolymer. This is due to the presence of calcium that could also form C-A-S-H more rapidly at ambient conditions that contribute to the strength development of the geopolymer mortar. Based on the amorphous ratios observed from this study, a contour plot is shown in Fig. 5 to illustrate the effect of Si/Al and (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al ratios on the compressive strength of the blended geopolymer mortar. The maximum compressive strength is observed when the (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al ratio is between 3.21 and 3.40 and the Si/Al ratio is between 2.2 and 3.1. However, more data is needed to confirm the optimal ratios, as this study only considers FA from two sources and GGBFS from one source. 4 Conclusions This research involved an investigation into the compressive strength development of FA and GGBFS composite geopolymer mortars cured at ambient temperature with the consideration of amorphous elemental molar ratios. Based on the presented experiment, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. An expanded amorphous-based mix design formulation for FA and GGBFS blended geopolymer has been derived. It is found that amorphous based mix design is suitable for blended geopolymer with calcium additive. 2. Based on the amorphous mix design of blended geopolymers, optimal amorphous Si/Al ratio for the Gladstone and Eraring based mixture to achieve the maximum compressive strength is found to be 2.3 in this study. It is important to note that when studies are compared on geopolymers, the quoted molar ratios must be ensured that they refer to amorphous ratios as amorphous ratios involve the reactive component of geopolymerisation. Bulk ratios do not give any indication as to the reactive component of the materials. 3. A new amorphous ratio, (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al, has been proposed in consideration of the contribution of both sodium and calcium to the formation of geopolymer binder. The optimal (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al ratio of geopolymer of blended FA and GGBFS is found to be between 3.21 and 3.40. 4. The addition of 40 to 50\u202fwt% GGBFS to geopolymer mixtures has been observed to provide the majority of the early age strength of up to 90% of 28\u202fdays compressive strength.

        "dc:description": "A new amorphous phase mix design framework had been successfully developed in consideration of calcium content through the combination of ground-granular blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) in fly ash (FA) blended geopolymers. The new framework has been developed considering the amorphous silicon, aluminium, sodium and calcium containing phases of the aluminosilicate sources to increase geopolymerisation reactivity and compressive strength. By utilising this new framework, this study found that the optimal amorphous Si/Al ratio of FA- and GGBFS-blended geopolymers are between 2.3 and 3.1. At 40\u201350% of FA replacement with GGBFS, it had been observed that blended geopolymers are able to achieve the majority of its 28\u202fdays compressive strength at 7\u202fdays. To account for the effect of calcium content, a new amorphous ratio, (Na\u202f+\u202f2Ca)/Al, is proposed, with an optimal ratio of between 3.2 and 3.4.",
