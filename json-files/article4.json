This study collected four ground granulated blast furnace slags from different manufacturing locations for CaO-activation to investigate the influence of the slag characteristics on strength development and the reaction products. Despite the seemingly similar characteristics of the slags, each slag developed significantly different strengths varying from 25 to 52 MPa at 28 days and different reaction products. The main reaction products were C-S-H and calcium hydroxide in all the samples; however, various forms of AFm phases appeared depending on the presence of calcite and calcium sulfates in the raw slags. Ettringite was also found in the case of raw slag with calcium sulfates. In this study, strength development was not governed by any single dominant material parameter of the raw slag, but rather by the combination of various favorable factors such as a higher content of calcium sulfates, a smaller overall particle size distribution and a higher basicity (or chemical indexes). Keywords GGBFS CaO-activation Hydration Strength Cementless binder 1 Introduction Granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) is an industrial by-product in the steel manufacturing process, and the ground form of GBFS is called ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), which is widely used for producing environmentally friendly construction materials. In particular, significant attention has been paid to alkali-activated GGBFS (AAS) [1\u20135], which uses alkaline solutions to create a strong binder, as an alternative material replacing Portland cement (OPC). Wang and Scrivener [1,6] reported that a main hydration product of AAS was calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) with a low C/S ratio near one, which was similar to that of C-S-H formed when a high replacement ratio of GGBFS was incorporated into OPC paste; and the structure of C-S-H in AAS was modified by aluminum substitution of silicon. In recent years, the structure of C-S-H in AAS has become fairly well understood [1\u20135]. Recently, several studies [7\u201310] attempted to use alkaline earth activators [e.g., Ca(OH)2, CaO, and MgO] for activating GGBFS because these are relatively cheaper and relatively safer for workers at construction sites due to their significantly lower pH values than that of alkaline solutions. Kim et al. [7] suggested that CaO was more appropriate as an activator than Ca(OH)2 for achieving higher strength development. The intrinsic material properties of raw GGBFS are the significant factors that affect the strength development of activated GGBFS. In particular, earlier studies have reported that particle size distribution, chemical composition, crystalline phases and glass content are important physical and chemical properties of raw GGBFS [11\u201315]. However, few earlier studies investigated the relationship between the material characteristics of GGBFS and strength development of CaO-activated GGBFS binder. The major chemical reaction in the CaO-activated GGBFS system is similar to that of the GGBFS-blended OPC system because both are basically the pozzolanic reaction [7]. Although earlier researchers [14\u201316] have investigated the properties and microstructures of GGBFS-blended OPC, the intrinsic material properties of raw GGBFS that significantly affect the pozzolanic reaction are not well understood because various chemical components in OPC could affect the pozzolanic reaction. Thus, investigating the CaO-activated GGBFS system could enable us to understand more the pozzolanic reaction of GGBFS without the other effects of various cement components (e.g., C3A, C4AF, etc.) on the reaction. In this study, four different GGBFSs were collected from the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Arab Emirates for producing CaO-activated GGBFS pastes. Raw GGBFSs and hardened pastes were examined to determine what material characteristics of GGBFS significantly influenced strength development and the reaction products using laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid-state 27Al and 29Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS-NMR), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) with derivative of thermogravimetry (DTG), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for secondary electron (SE) and back-scattered electron (BSE) images with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. 2 Experimental methods Four commercially available GGBFSs were purchased from three countries for this study: Republic of Korea, (labeled SK-1, and SK-2), Singapore (labeled SS), and Dubai, Arab Emirates (labeled SD). SK-1 and SK-2 were manufactured by different vendors in Korea, but the original granulated blast furnace slags (GBFS) were generated from the same steel manufacturer in Korea. Although SS was a commercial GGBFS in Singapore, the raw GBFS was imported from Japan. Likewise, SD was manufactured in Dubai, but the raw material for SD was a blended slag using GBFSs from China and India. The four GGBFSs were examined using XRF (S8 Tiger wavelength dispersive XRF spectrometer, Bruker, USA), powder XRD (High power X-ray diffractometer, Rigaku, Japan), laser diffraction particle size analysis [Sympatec HELOS (HI 199) and RODOS, Germany], 27Al MAS-NMR and 29Si MAS-NMR (400 MHz Avance II+ Bruker Solid-state NMR instrument, Bruker, USA) to obtain qualitative and quantitative material properties. In addition, the calcite contents were estimated using TGA for the GGBFSs that contained calcite (CaCO3) (i.e., SS and SD). The GGBFSs were activated with an analytical grade of calcium oxide (CaO, above 97.0%, Daejung chemicals). The 10 wt% of activator and 40 wt% of water were added to the GGBFSs. The mixture proportions of the different paste samples are shown in Table 1 . GGBFS was dry-mixed with CaO powder for 5 min and mixed with de-ionized water. After waiting for 30 s for water absorption, the pastes were further mixed following ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) C305 [17]. The mixed pastes were cast separately in cubic molds (5 × 5 × 5 cm) for compressive strength testing and in cylindrical molds (ϕ2.54 cm × 2.54 cm) to prepare samples for MIP and SEM testing. The cast pastes were cured in a humidity chamber at 23 ± 2 °C and above 95% relative humidity for 24 h. After that, the samples were de-molded and cured at the same curing condition until tested. The compressive strength tests were conducted at 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after casting. The strengths were determined as averaged values using triplicate samples for each mixture proportion. Fractured pieces were collected after the compressive testing and finely ground for the XRD, TGA and NMR experiments to pass through 100 μm sieves. The cylindrical samples were sliced at 2-mm thicknesses for SEM analysis and cut into 5 × 5 × 5 mm samples for MIP tests using a precision saw. To stop further hydration, the solvent-exchange method was used with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for all specimens [18]. The samples were dried in a vacuum desiccator under ∼60 cmHg pressure for 24 h before testing. Thin-sectioned samples were prepared at a thickness of ∼30 μm for SEM BSE imaging analysis with a PetroThin thin-sectioning system (Buehler Co., USA) using 9 μm, 6 μm, 3 μm and 1/2 μm diamond suspensions. The prepared specimens were coated with osmium before SEM testing. SEM−SE imaging analysis was carried out for saw-cut samples without the thin-sectioning process using a high-resolution field emission SEM (Nova NanoSEM 230, USA). The SEM-BSE analysis was conducted for the thin-sectioned samples using a high-resolution field emission SEM (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The XRD patterns for raw GGBFS and hardened paste powders were recorded using a high power powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) within the 2θ range of 5°\u201360°. To estimate the weight contents of the glass phase in the raw GGBFSs, an internal standard (NIST RMS 676a, crystalline alumina 99.02% ± 1.11%) was used [19]. All GGBFSs were mixed with the internal standard at a weight ratio of 9:1 between the GGBFS and crystalline alumina. All recorded XRD patterns were analyzed using X\u2019pert HighScore Plus software [20] with the ICDD (International Center for Diffraction Data) PDF-2 database [21] and ICSD (Inorganic Crystal Structure Database) [22]. Solid-state MAS-NMR tests were performed for 29Si and 27Al using a 400 MHz Avance II+ solid-state NMR instrument (Bruker, USA) with a magnetic field strength of 9.4 T and ZrO2 4-mm rotors at ambient temperature under conditions of proton decoupling with a 30° pulse at pulse repetition delays of 100 s and 3 s, respectively, for quantitative analysis with a spinning rate of 10 kHz and 14 kHz. The recorded 29Si and 27Al spectra were referenced relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) and 1 M AlCl3 (aq.), respectively, at 0.0 ppm in the chemical shift. The TGA data were measured using SDT Q600 (TA Instruments, USA) with an alumina pan from ambient temperature to 1000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen environment. The pore structures of the hardened pastes were measured with an Auto pore IV 9500 (Micomeritics Instrument Co., USA) under a pressure range from sub-ambient to 60,000 psi (414 MPa). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization of raw GGBFSs The particle size distributions of the raw GGBFSs are shown in Fig. 1 , which shows the averaged plots from three independent measurements for each GGBFS. The size distributions were not markedly different from each other because these GGBFSs should satisfy some standards such as Korean standard (KS) or ASTM for use in commercial purposes. Nonetheless, each GGBFS qualitatively had its own distinctive characteristics for size distribution as follows: (1) SK-2 possessed the finest size distribution; (2) SD had the coarsest size distribution; (3) The particle size distribution of SK-1 was between SK-2 and SD; and (4) SS simultaneously had large fractions of both very small and large particles but had the smallest percentage of middle sized particles ranging from 3 to 30 μm. To quantitatively describe the characteristics of the particle size distributions, the distribution equation of Rosin-Rammler-Bennett (RRB) [23] was fitted to the particle size distributions of the GGBFS. The RRB equation is often used to characterize the particle size distributions of Portland cement [24] and GGBFS [11,12]. The RRB equation is defined as follows: (1) R = 100 e − ( x x 0 ) n , where R is a fraction of the residual particles in the x-μm mesh in %; x0 is the mesh size at 36.8% of the particles retained; and n is the slope index. By defining Y = ln ( 100 R ) , X = ln x , and b = n ln x , the RRB equation is linearized into Y = n X − b , which was used for the curve-fitting. A larger value of n represents a higher fraction of small sized particles in a sample of powder. On the other hand, a lager x0 value represents a higher portion of large particles in a sample. The curve-fitted results for the GGBFSs are presented in the in-set table of Fig. 1, which shows all the curves are well fitted with the RRB equation (see R2 values). The order of magnitude for the values of n and x0 from the fitted results was SK-2 > SK-1 ≅ SD > SS and SD > SS > SK-1 > SK-2, respectively. Although the n value for SS fails to show any considerable presence of very small particles, overall, the values of n and x0 reasonably describe the size distributions of the GGBFS particles, similarly to the qualitative description above. The oxide compositions of the GGBFSs from XRF are shown in Table 2 . The hydraulic reactivity of GGBFS is often estimated using various types of hydraulic indexes or modulus [15,25\u201327]. For instance, Korean Standard (KS) F 2563 [28] uses the term basicity as (CaO + MgO + Al2O3)/(SiO2), which is required to be larger than 1.60. The other hydraulic indexes containing some minor components of GGBFS are presented [26] such as (CaO + MgO + Al2O3)/(SiO2 + MnO + TiO2). In Table 2, all GGBFSs had few significant differences in their oxide compositions [29], basicity and chemical indexes; in particular, SK-1 and SK-2 are quite similar to each other except for the SO3 content. Using the reference intensity ratio (RIR) method [30,31] with an internal standard, the phase contents in each GGBFS were approximately calculated (Table 3 ) from the measured XRD patterns for the raw GGBFSs, which are included in Fig. 3 in the later section. To improve the accuracy of the RIR analysis, the best well-matched pattern among PDF databases was selected with consideration of the score provided by X\u2019pert HighScore Plus software. Although the accuracy of the RIR method is generally lower than that of the Rietveld method [32,33], the accuracy of the RIR in this study is likely to be comparable because the resolutions of the measured patterns were not sufficiently high for the Rietveld method. The calcite contents were estimated for SS and SD. Note that the strong peak of gypsum at ∼29° was closely located with the strongest reflection of calcite, and accordingly, the RIR method is likely to overestimate the calcite content in SS. Thus, the calcite contents were also measured with TGA for better accuracy shown in Fig. 5. It is not clear whether calcite was formed through carbonation of the calcium in the GGBFS, or whether it was intentionally added during the milling process. In general, the presence of calcite could affect cement hydration in several ways: (1) it can modify the AFm phases by converting monosulfate to hemi-carboaluminate or mono-carboaluminate, and also, it could generate an additional AFt phase resulting in improved mechanical strength; (2) it could increase the strength by acting as fillers; (3) however, it could reduce the strength because of un-reacted residues when it is added in large amounts [34,35]. Further discussion will be made on the influence of calcite in the CaO-activated GGBFS system in a later section of the paper. Calcium sulfates (i.e., anhydrite and gypsum) were present in the raw samples of GGBFS. These were probably added during the milling process to improve the grinding efficiency or to meet the standard requirements for the chemical composition of commercial GGBFS powders (e.g., KS basicity or other chemical indexes). The basicity and chemical indexes can be modified through the addition of anhydrite or gypsum due to the increase of the CaO content. The addition of these sulfate sources also increases the SO3 content in the oxide composition shown in Table 2. When anhydrite and gypsum are excluded in the calculation for the glass content, the inherent contents of the glass phase could be 100% for SK-1 and SK-2, 97.6% for SD, and 97.2% for SS. If we also regard the calcite as external inclusions, the original glass contents of all the raw GGBFSs could be 100%. The 29Si and 27Al MAS-NMR spectra were taken for the raw GGBFSs but are also included in the later section in Fig. 8 and Fig. 10, respectively, with those of the hardened pastes for discussion purposes; the intensities of all spectra were rescaled to have visually the same area so that they could be directly compared between GGBFSs. The peak locations of the 29Si MAS-NMR spectra for the raw GGBFSs ranged from −75 ∼ −76 ppm, agreeing with previous studies; Schilling et al. [36] and Bernal et al. [37] proposed −74.0 ppm and −76.0 ppm, respectively. In the 27Al MAS-NMR results, most spectra for the raw GGBFSs showed a 4-fold coordinated aluminum similar to earlier studies [2,10,36\u201338]. 3.2 Compressive strength testing results The strength development of each GGBFS appeared significantly different to each other shown in Fig. 2 . The strength of CA-SS was the best for all curing ages while the strength of CA-SD was mostly the worst. Earlier studies [14,15,26,39] attempted to use the chemical composition of GGBFS as a simple measure for predicting the hydraulic reactivity of GGBFS. Similarly, the KS [28] and the other standards use the basicity and chemical indexes, which are calculated from the chemical composition of the GGBFS. All GGBFSs in this study complied with the KS (above 1.6). However, the relationship between strength development and chemical composition of the raw GGBFS was not clearly revealed in this study. For instance, although SD had relatively large values of basicity and chemical index, CA-SD had the lowest strength for all curing ages. In addition, although SK-1 and SK-2 had very similar values, their strength developments were quite different. These observations indicate that the chemical composition in this study was not the overwhelming determinant for the compressive strength; however, the combined effect with other parameters such as the particle size, content of calcium sulfates, glass contents or types of crystalline phases present could be more important. Note that ASTM C989 [40] does not use any chemical measures except for the sulfide sulfur (S) content (less than 2.5%) and recommends to use the activity index, which is estimated from the direct strength test for mortars. A direct comparison between SK-1 and SK-2 shows that the content of calcium sulfates is probably more influential on the strength development than the particle size distribution given that the other material characteristics were quite similar such as the oxide composition, origin of GBFS, and glass contents. 3.3 Powder X-ray diffraction The XRD patterns of the hardened pastes at 3, 14, and 28 days are shown in Fig. 3 . The identified phases were illustrated using the reference patterns obtained from the ICDD PDF-2 database; however, the pattern for C-S-H (calcium silicate hydrate) was referenced from Mohan and Taylor [41] after eliminating the peaks for calcium hydroxide because the database did not include the amorphous characteristics of C-S-H. No matched phase was found in the ICDD PDF-2 database for the reflections at 2θ = 10.8° and 21.6° at 3 days, marked with \u2018H\u2019 in Fig. 3(a) and vanished after 3 days; however, these reflections were identified as \u2018hydroxy-AFm type solid solution\u2019, which was reported as a variant of the AFm phase in Ref. [35]. CA-SK-1 and CA-SK-2 commonly exhibited C-S-H and calcium hydroxide peaks in XRD. Calcium hydroxide was produced from quick lime (CaO), which was rapidly transformed to Ca(OH)2 when it dissolved in water. Ettringite and kuzelite, which is a similar phase with monosulfate [10], can easily form when a calcium sulfate source is sufficiently present. Because the structure of the AFm phase is easily modified by anion exchange, AFm has various forms of solid solutions, which exhibit reflections at similar 2θ values [34,35,42]. Thus, it is sometimes difficult to accurately identify AFm phases in XRD using the PDF-2 database. However, given that SK-1 and SK-2 had the same origin, the reflections near at 10°\u201312° in CA-SK-1 and CA-SK-2 are likely to indicate similar AFm phases. Although the XRD patterns for CA-SS displayed the most complex patterns compared to the others, because many of the identified phases were already present in the original GGBFS, the reaction products were similar to those of the others; C-S-H, calcium hydroxide, ettringite, and monocarboaluminate (rhombohedral-type) were identified as the main reaction products. Considering that gypsum and calcite were present in the raw slag of SS (see Table 3), monocarboaluminate probably formed by anion exchange of monosulfate with CO3 2− ions seen in previous studies [34,35]. The sample CA-SD had two types of carbonate phases which are rhombohedral-type monocarboaluminate and anorthic-type monocarboaluminate; these phases possess similar chemical compositions and structures; thus, these may exist closely in a solid solution form because solid solutions of AFm phases are very common in cementitious systems [34,35,42]. CA-SK-1 presented the most significant temporal changes in the XRD patterns among the samples while the other samples showed almost no change after 3 days except for the peak growths of monocarboaluminate in CA-SS and CA-SD near 10°. In CA-SK-1, the strong peaks of kuzelite and hydroxy-AFm type solid solution almost disappeared after 3 days; it also exhibited a substantial decrease of calcium hydroxide up to 14 days. 3.4 Thermogravimetric analysis As in the TGA data in Fig. 4 , the reaction products were identified referring to an earlier study [7] that tabulated various TGA data for hydration products. The TGA results were fairly consistent with those of the XRD results for the reaction products at 28 days. The weight losses between 60 °C and 150 °C were mainly attributed to the decompositions of ettringite (AFt) and C-S-H; these phases are generally major hydration products for strength in cementitious materials [27,43], and thus, the largest weight loss of C-S-H and ettringite in CA-SS agreed well with the strength testing result. In particular, the larger formation of ettringite should be related to higher early strengths at 3 days as seen in an earlier study [44]. The weight losses in the temperature range from 115 °C to 170 °C were related to the AFm phases. The first peaks at 130 °C were probably due to the dehydrations of the monocarboaluminate phases [45\u201347] and the latter peaks at 145 °C could be related to that of the monosulfate [7]. A comparison of the peak intensities of the monocarboaluminate showed that CA-SD produced more monocarboaluminate than CA-SS, which is in agreement with the XRD result. All samples showed noticeable weight losses from 380 °C to 450 °C, which were related to the dehydration of calcium hydroxide. The calcium hydroxide contents were calculated using the weight ratio of [Ca(OH)2]/[H2O], and the results are shown in Fig. 4(d). The residual Ca(OH)2 is an important indicator that shows whether the pH of the hardened pastes is over 12.5, which is a criterion for inhibiting corrosion problems in steel-reinforced concrete [43]. The calcite contents of the CA-SS and CA-SD were calculated from the TGA results, which showed CaCO3 around 600 °C\u2013700 °C. Although the analysis of XRD also gave the approximate weights of the calcites for CA-SS and CA-SD, the accuracy of the quantifications in the RIR method was too low to be used for detailed comparison because the calcite contents were small. Fig. 5 compares the weight reductions of the CaCO3 over 28 days, showing that (1) CaCO3 dissolved during 28 days; and (2) although the absolute values of the reduction were different between CA-SS and CA-SD, both samples showed a similar reduction ratio of 68%. These observations indirectly explain the various CO2-bearing reaction products (e.g., monocarboaluminates and paraalumohydrocalcite) with strong reflections in the XRD patterns in CA-SS and -SD. Although the TGA curves of CA-SK-1, CA-SK-2 and CA-SD were not much different, the strengths of these samples were significantly different at 28 days; thus, in this study, the quantity of the reaction products was not a dominant factor for strength development. 3.5 Solid-state 29Si and 27Al MAS-NMR The spectra of 29Si MAS-NMR are presented in Fig. 6 for all the hardened pastes and raw GGBFSs with the deconvoluted curves (see Table 4 ). The deconvolution of 29Si MAS-NMR spectra was performed using the DMFit software package [48] referring to earlier studies [2,3,10,36\u201338,49,50]; the Gaussian function was used for fitting the spectra of the original GGBFS and unreacted GGBFS; however, the Lorentzian was used for the other deconvoluted curves of the Q1 and Q2 peaks [36]; following Bernal et al. [37], we also assumed that the original positions and shapes of the unreacted GGBFS spectra would not be changed after CaO-activation, but only the intensities would be reduced during curing. Thus, in the deconvolution process, to assign residual GGBFS (i.e., Q0), the original location and shape of spectrum curve of raw GGBFS were used, and only the intensity of the curve was adjusted; in particular, FWHH (full width at half height) of each deconvoluted curve for Q1 and Q2 was limited to below 10 ppm in deconvolution after referring to Bernal et al. [37]. Based on the deconvolution results, the degree of dissolution (DOD) of Si in each GGBFS sample was calculated as \u2018100 \u2013 area of Q0\u2019; the mean chain length (MCL) of C-S-H and Al/Si atomic ratio in C-S-H were also calculated using equations (2) and (3) [49,51,52]. The plots of the MCL, Al/Si ratio and strength versus the calculated DOD are presented in Fig. 9. (2) MCL = 2 { Q 1 + Q 2 ( 0 A l ) + 3 2 Q 2 ( 1 A l ) } Q 1 (3) A l / S i a t o m i c r a t i o = 1 2 Q 2 ( 1 A l ) Q 1 + Q 2 ( 0 A l ) + Q 2 ( 1 A l ) The MCL and strength approximately showed a linear relationship with the DOD; however, the values of the Al/Si ratio in this study were quite smaller than those from other types of activation such as Ca(OH)2- [10,50] or alkali-activations for GGBFS [38,50,53]. A smaller fraction of residual Si in raw GGBFS (i.e., smaller Q0 site) generally indicates a higher degree of GGBFS dissolution (i.e., DOD). If all dissolved phases of GGBFS are supposed to be used for producing reaction products, considering the similar TGA curves between CA-SK-1, CA-SK-2 and CA-SD, the fractions of dissolved GGBFSs are also expected to be similar in Fig. 7 ; however, CA-SK-2 showed a much larger degree of dissolution than that of CA-SK-1 and CA-SD, even slightly larger than CA-SS. This might suggest that although SK-2 was highly dissolved, a large portion of dissolved GGBFS could not participate in the reactions that produced the major reaction products. Thus, the dissolution degree of Si in GGBFS is not necessarily a direct measure of the reaction degree of CaO-activation. The MAS-NMR results of 27Al are shown in Fig. 8. Because GGBFS was the only source of aluminum in this study, the total number of Al atoms must be the same in each sample after activation. Thus, to directly observe the transition of the 27Al spectra after activation, the intensities of the spectra for the raw GGBFS and 28-day paste were normalized to have the same areas for all samples. The spectrum of each hardened sample consisted of three spectral components: 4-fold coordinated Al [i.e. Al(IV)] near 40\u201380 ppm, 5-fold Al [i.e. Al(V)] around 15\u201340 ppm, and 6-fold Al [i.e. Al(VI)] at about −20 to 15 ppm [54]. In Fig. 10(e), the peaks around 13 ppm were probably due to ettringite formation [55,56], and the peaks near 10 ppm could be attributed to various AFm phases such as kuzelite (monosulfate), monocarboaluminate, and other possible AFm phases [55\u201358]. Ettringite was identified in the TGA results of CA-SK-1, CA-SK-2, and CA-SS; AFm phases were also found in all samples consistent with the XRD and TGA results. In this study, the reduction of area of Al(IV) [or Al(IV) + Al(V)] after activation is almost equivalent to the dissolution degree (DOD) of Al for the raw GGBFS because a very small quantity of Al(IV) was present in the reaction product (see the very low values of the Al/Si ratios in C-S-H in Fig. 7). Comparing Fig. 7 with Fig. 8(e), except for SK-2, GGBFS with the higher DOD of Si roughly exhibited a higher DOD of Al; however, despite the highest DOD of Si in SK-2, SK-2 showed the lowest DOD of Al, which explains the smallest growths of peaks of the AFt and AFm phases in CA-SK-2. This observation might suggest that the dissolution degree of Al could be different from that of Si for the raw GGBFS as an irregular case. 3.6 Mercury intrusion porosimetry Fig. 9 shows the MIP results for the hardened pastes at 28 days. In this study, two categories of pore sizes were found: capillary pores smaller than 2 μm and air bubbles near 100 μm [43]. The pore size distribution is known as a better measure for evaluating the strength characteristics of hardened pastes than other pore characteristics (e.g., total pore volume or porosity); for instance, capillary pores larger than 50 nm could reduce the strength more, but pores smaller than 50 nm usually affect drying shrinkage and creep [43]. CA-SS had relatively the finest pore size distribution and smallest total volume of pores, while CA-SD had much larger sizes of capillary pores than the other samples although the total volume was not the largest. Despite the similar material characteristics of the raw SK-1 and SK-2 except for slight differences in the contents of the calcium sulfates and particle size distributions, CA-SK-1 and CA-SK-2 had observable differences in the MIP result as follows: (1) CA-SK-1 had a 10-fold larger volume of air bubbles than CA-SK-2 near 100 μm; however, (2) CA-SK-1 also had smaller sizes of capillary pores and a smaller total pore volume than CA-SK-2. Note that the air bubbles are relatively less detrimental to strength than capillary pores because air bubbles are generally spherical unlike capillary pores [43]. Therefore, based on the above discussion, the pore size distributions in Fig. 9 were reasonably consistent with the strength testing results. For better understanding of the MIP results, the relationships of the strengths at 28 days are depicted in Fig. 10 for total pore volume and average pore diameter. In this study, the average pore diameter showed relatively well an inverse-proportional trend with the strength, while the total pore volume (ml/g) showed a relatively poor relationship with the compressive strength; for example, the strength of CA-SK-1 was 78% higher than that of CA-SD with similar total pore volumes. Note that the large fraction of unreacted GGBFS particles may have distorted the relationship between the total pore volume and strength in this study. When the fraction of unreacted GGBFS particles increases in a hardened paste, the strength decreases because the unreacted GGBFS particles do not contribute to the strength; however, the total pore volume of the paste may also decrease because unreacted GGBFS particles are generally denser than the hydration products of the CaO-activated pastes. 3.7 Scanning electron microscopy BSE images were taken from the polished sections of hardened samples at 28 days shown in Fig. 11 . All samples showed significant portions of unreacted GGBFS particles over large areas. As discussed earlier, these unreacted GGBFS particles were probably the reason why the total pore volume (or porosity) from MIP was not correlated with strength because density of GGBFS is much denser than that of hydration products. Thus, to exclude the influence of the unreacted GGBFS particles to estimate the total pore volumes of the hardened paste matrices, the carbon contents were measured on the polished surfaces of the samples using EDS because most of the carbon detection was mainly due to the epoxy resin that filled pores of the paste matrix, and thus, the carbon content from EDS indirectly represents the total pore volume of the hardened matrix. For each sample, the carbon contents were measured at 44 to 72 locations, which were sufficiently far away from the GGBFS particles. The average value of the carbon content for each sample was plotted with the compressive strength shown in Fig. 12 . A clear linear relationship was found between the average carbon content and the compressive strength; this is consistent with the general notion that the porosity of a solid is inversely proportional to the strength [43]. Fig. 13 shows the exemplary BSE images of congregate pieces of calcite, frequently found in CA-SS and CA-SD. Note that the calcite clusters in CA-SD were highly porous and significantly large, nearly 200 μm in diameter, and thus, these could be fragile points for crack initiations in the hardened pastes under loading and could be one of the possible causes for the low strength of CA-SD. Fig. 14 shows the microstructures of the pore regions, filled with calcite pieces and considered as similar region of Fig. 13(b), in the CA-SD sample. A large number of aggregate-like calcite crystals were found with highly porous matrices. In addition, the crystals of relatively large plate-like morphologies were found near calcites, which may be considered as calcium hydroxide crystals [see Fig. 14(c)]. These porous regions can play a role in reducing compressive strength as a defect. 4 Conclusions This study collected four commercial GGBFSs from different manufacturing locations for CaO-activation to examine (a) how different the strength developments were under the same activating condition and (b) which slag characteristics of raw GGBFS significantly influence strength development and the reaction products. The following conclusions were made based on the results of laser particle diffraction, XRF, XRD, compressive strength test, TGA, MIP, 29Si and 27Al MAS-NMR, and SEM imaging analysis as follows: (1) Despite the apparently analogous characteristics between all the raw GGBFSs in this study, careful examination revealed that the GGBFSs showed some differences in their chemical and physical characteristics that could affect strength development and the reaction products. (2) Each GGBFS produced very different degrees of strength development after CaO-activation; the strength variations appeared from 25 to 52 MPa at 28 days. (3) The strength developments and reaction products were not determined by a single dominant material parameter of the raw GGBFS but rather by the combination of various factors; favorable characteristics of GGBFS for high strength are (a) higher calcium sulfate content, (b) finer particle sizes, and (c) higher basicity and chemical index, while the influence of the glass content was not notable in this study because the glass contents were very similar between the GGFBSs; higher calcium sulfate content was the most influence factor than the other factors in this study. (4) Main hydration products of the CaO-activated GGBFS were C-S-H and calcium hydroxide in all samples; various AFm phases also formed in all samples, but in particular, GGBFSs with more dissolvable calcite produced a higher quantity of CO2-bearing AFm phases. (5) Ettringite was also found in the hardened pastes of GGBFSs when the raw GGBFSs contained calcium sulfates; the larger formation of ettringite was found to be related to the higher early strengths at 3 days similar to an earlier study. (6) The hardened samples with finer sizes of capillary pores had better strength developments; the average pore size was more relevant to strength rather than the total pore volume (ml/g). (7) The total pore volume (or porosity) from MIP may not be a good indicator for strength when a large fraction of unreacted GGBFS particles remain in hardened pastes, leading to a reduction in the pore volume from MIP without strength increase, because these GGBFS particles are much denser than that of the hydration products. (8) The average carbon contents were measured using EDS for polished sample surfaces sufficiently away from the unreacted GGBFS particles; the inverse-proportional relationship was clearly identified between the compressive strength and average carbon content. (9) The DOD of Si in GGFBS had roughly linear proportional relationships with the mean chain length of C-S-H and with the compressive strength; however, the DOD of Si is not necessarily a direct measure of the reaction degree of CaO-activation or the DOD of Al. (10) The cluster of many calcites in SD could reduce the compressive strength of CA-SD because these could be the points of crack initiations under loading.

        "dc:description": "This study collected four ground granulated blast furnace slags from different manufacturing locations for CaO-activation to investigate the influence of the slag characteristics on strength development and the reaction products. Despite the seemingly similar characteristics of the slags, each slag developed significantly different strengths varying from 25 to 52 MPa at 28 days and different reaction products. The main reaction products were C-S-H and calcium hydroxide in all the samples; however, various forms of AFm phases appeared depending on the presence of calcite and calcium sulfates in the raw slags. Ettringite was also found in the case of raw slag with calcium sulfates. In this study, strength development was not governed by any single dominant material parameter of the raw slag, but rather by the combination of various favorable factors such as a higher content of calcium sulfates, a smaller overall particle size distribution and a higher basicity (or chemical indexes).",
