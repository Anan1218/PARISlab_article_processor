Calcareous fly ashes are high-potential reactive residues for blended cements, but their qualification and use in concrete are hindered by heterogeneity and variability. Current characterization often fails to identify the dominant, most reactive, amorphous fraction of the ashes. We developed an approach to characterize ashes using electron microscopy. EDS element composition of millions of points is plotted in a ternary frequency plot. A visual analysis reveals number and ranges of chemical composition of populations: silicate, calcium-silicate, aluminosilicate, and calcium-rich aluminosilicate. We quantified these populations in four ashes and followed their hydration in two Portland-ash systems. One ash reacted at a moderate rate: it was composed of 70vol.% of aluminosilicates and calcium-silicates and reached 60% reaction at 90days. The other reacted faster, reaching 60% at 28days due to 55vol.% of calcium-rich aluminosilicates, but further reaction was slower and 15vol.% of phases, the silica-rich ones, did not react. Keywords Characterization (B) EDX (B) Image analysis (B) Blended cement (D) Fly ash (D) 1 Introduction The world's production of concrete is estimated to be 20\u201337 Gt per year [1] and growing. Most of the related costs and CO2 emissions are linked to the clinkerization process. Fly ashes can substitute for part of the Portland clinker, but despite large availability (around 670Mt [2] are produced every year) only around 30wt.% [2] is used in concrete. This is because fly ashes are inherently heterogeneous and variable. Coal type, combustion temperature, processing, and other factors influence fly ash properties [3\u20136]. Indeed, many fly ashes are discarded out of hand due to potentially low or variable quality. In an attempt to categorize fly ashes, standards such as EN 197-1 [7] and ASTM C618 [8] divide them by their bulk chemical composition. The EN standard distinguishes siliceous (CaOreactive <10wt.%) and calcareous (CaOreactive >10wt.%) fly ashes, the ASTM divides them into class F (SiO2 +Al2O3 +Fe2O3 >70wt.%) and C (SiO2 +Al2O3 +Fe2O3 >50wt.%). Most of the fly ashes in use are the less variable and less heterogeneous but also less reactive siliceous fly ashes. Due to this low reactivity, the clinker substitution limit is around 35wt.% [7]. It could be increased, but the more reactive calcareous fly ashes are frequently rejected due to their significantly greater heterogeneity. Indeed, calcareous fly ashes are considerably more difficult to characterize and remain poorly understood. This is essentially caused by the lack of appropriate techniques both for the characterization of raw fly ashes and for the measurement of their reaction in hydrated blended cement. 1.1 Characterization of raw fly ash More effective tools to characterize fly ash are much needed, but usually the only data easily available for classification is bulk chemical composition by XRF. XRD-Rietveld refinement can quantify the crystalline phases [9]. The main obstacle for characterization is the dominant amorphous phase. Indeed, glass may represent up to 90% of the total fly ash weight and contain a mixture of different compositions [10,11]. Unfortunately, XRD mostly fails to distinguish between the amorphous fly ash phases. Electron microscopy WDS (wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) or EDS (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) is the most common approach to study fly ash glass and analyse chemical composition of different particles [11\u201317]. In manual mode the operator selects points for examination, but as fly ashes are very heterogeneous, the scatter of the results is large and makes detailed analysis difficult. A new approach to SEM-EDS image analysis was described by Lydon [18] for measurement of modal mineralogy of rocks and was later adapted by Chancey [19] for characterization of siliceous fly ashes. Fast, new generation EDS detectors can collect a spectrum for every pixel of the frame within an hour. The spectra are then processed into a set of element intensity maps and analysed using MultiSpecÂ© [20], a multispectral image analysis software, in which a clustering algorithm is used to identify and quantify groups of mutually exclusive chemical compositions. The display of a segmented image allows insight into microstructure, notably location of phases and intermixing. The analysis can treat large amounts of data but the interpretation is time-consuming, not intuitive and requires a skilled operator. The clustering algorithm can become very operator-dependent if the number of groups is not specified, which is usual for fly ash. If the chemical composition is evaluated directly from the X-ray count or normalized to 0\u2013255 in an intensity image it may lead to false conclusions on the actual chemical composition of the identified phases. 1.2 Measuring the degree of reaction of fly ash A reliable quantification of the fly ash degree of reaction (the proportion that has reacted) in a hydrated cement paste is difficult. The most commonly used indirect methods are the measurement of the amount of Portlandite and non-evaporable water [21\u201325]. Using these methods the differentiation between the reaction of fly ash and Portland clinker requires a comparison with a reference in which fly ash is replaced by an appropriate inert filler. Indeed, the anhydrous fly ash is quantified only indirectly, which means that changes in the type and amount of hydrates may greatly affect the results. Therefore, other methods were sought to measure the amount of unreacted fly ash directly. Selective dissolution [24\u201327] is meant to eliminate the hydration products and leave the anhydrous part for quantification. However, studies show that a significant fraction of the fly ash may be dissolved, while some hydrates remain [28]. Reactivity tests in highly diluted solutions provide a more theoretical approach, but were argued not to address the fly ash reactivity in cement adequately as they are carried out outside of paste [11]. Backscattered electron image analysis (BSE-IA) can determine the degree of reaction of plain Portland clinkers [29\u201333] and was further developed to tackle blended cements [28,34,35]. In BSE images, the grey level is a function of element composition [33] and different peaks in a grey level histogram can basically be attributed to different phases, separated and quantified. However, fly ash often contains several different glasses with different grey levels that may overlap with those of clinker phases, slag [34], C\u2013(A)\u2013S\u2013H or Portlandite [28]. Additional filters aid the process [28,35], but an accurate separation and quantification is difficult and sometimes impossible, especially for the more complex, calcareous fly ashes. Given the limited accuracy of the aforementioned methods, fly ash can only be treated as a single entity although it is a mixture of different compositions [11,19,36] that react at different rates [37,38]. Furthermore, the morphology of particles is generally not addressed. Improved characterization and quantification methods are needed to better understand the mechanisms acting in fly ash composite cements. Generic knowledge can only be developed if the methods are robust so that a multitude of different fly ashes can be investigated. This paper presents a new numerical treatment of SEM-EDS full element maps that allows quick and intuitive visual identification, precise separation and quantitative analysis of phases in fly ash. Parameters for collection and treatment of EDS data were studied and validated on a model sample. We propose a ternary frequency diagram to display and evaluate the chemical composition of millions of data points in a single plot. Groups of similar chemical compositions appear as blobs in the diagram so the user can readily distinguish them and evaluate their ranges and scatter. Display of the groups facilitates the analysis of fly ash microstructure while the calculation of their respective volume fractions sets a baseline for quantitative comparisons within a fly ash and between different ashes. Further, the different glassy components of a fly ash can be identified in a hydrated Portland\u2013fly ash paste and their degrees of reaction followed individually. 2 Materials Portland cement (PC), three calcareous fly ashes (FA1, FA2, FA3), one siliceous fly ash (FA4), two slags (S1, S2) and a synthetic glass (G) ground to around 4200cm2/g Blaine as well as gypsum ground to around 7000cm2/g Blaine were used in the study. The bulk chemical and phase compositions of the raw materials were analysed by XRF (Table 1 ) and XRD-Rietveld (Table 2 ). Fly ashes 2 and 3 had similar chemical composition but differed in phase composition. Particle size distributions were measured by laser diffraction in isopropanol dispersions using Malvern MasterSizer S (Fig. 17 ). 3 Experimental 3.1 Sample preparation To test the capacity for quantification, a model sample was prepared with three homogeneous and amorphous materials\u2014two slags: S1, S2 and a synthetic glass G. The materials were mixed in a proportion of 1:1:1 by mass, compacted into a pellet and embedded in epoxy resin. Their volume fractions were calculated using densities obtained according to [39] and are included in Table 3 . Samples for fly ash characterization contained single raw fly ashes in resin-embedded pellets. For the study of fly ash hydration we prepared powder mixtures of 55wt.% PC and 45wt.% FA1 and FA2. Gypsum was added to adjust the SO3 content to 3.25wt.%. The powders were mixed with water (w/b wt. ratio 0.4) in a laboratory mixer for 2min at 1600rpm. The pastes were cured at 20Â°C in cylindrical PP containers in sealed conditions until testing after 1, 7, 28, 56, 90 and 365days. At the designated times, discs were cut from the samples and immersed into isopropanol to stop hydration by solvent exchange. The isopropanol was exchanged three times over the 7-day storage period. The disks were then dried and stored in a desiccator with silica gel beads and under vacuum for another 7days to evacuate the isopropanol. Part of the disc was crushed in a mortar and analysed by XRD and TGA while the remainder was pre-polished to assure a flat surface, a requirement for uniform epoxy impregnation and polishing. All samples for SEM investigations were impregnated under vacuum with a spectrally transparent epoxy resin (EpoTekÂ® 301), gradually polished down to Â¼Î¼m with diamond spray and petrol as a lubricant and coated with a thin conductive layer of carbon (10nm). 3.2 Microscope setup The scanning electron microscope used for this study was a FEI Quanta 200 with Bruker XFlash 4030 EDS detector with 30mm2 active surface. The microscope was operated at 15kV accelerating voltage and 12.5mm working distance. The field of view was 252Î¼mÃ189Î¼m, the image resolution was 1024Ã768 and the pixel size 0.246Ã0.246Î¼m. The system was configured to take a backscatter electron image (BSE) and to carry out EDS element mapping. To analyse and interpret the element maps in detail, the acquisition of high quality spectra is essential. A large spot size was used to obtain high EDS count rate of 100000\u2013150000 counts per second. Due to fast detector and signal processing the dead time remained between 0 and 5%. A dwell time of 256Î¼s was chosen to keep the scanning speed at a moderate rate. It provided balance between poorer measurement statistics at high speeds and larger sample damage at lower speeds. An automated routine analysed eight frames per sample, which corresponds to approximately 20000 particles. The total acquisition time was around 4.5h per sample. Eight frames per sample per testing age were considered a good compromise between the size of the analysed area and the measurement time. Compared to other studies using SEM, eight frames may seem very few but the information carried in a precise EDS map allows a more accurate analysis and therefore less frames need to be measured. Samples made of compacted powder contain more particles per unit surface of the polished section compared to paste samples: a paste of 70% Portland clinker and 30% fly ash at 0.4 water/binder ratio contains around four times less fly ash. Eight frames measured on raw compacted powder are thus equivalent to 32 on paste, which is typical of the numbers of images often used in paste studies. The accuracy and errors are analysed in detail in Appendix 2. 3.3 Data treatment The following elements were quantified from the spectra: Al, Si, Ca, Na, K, Mg, Fe, Ti and P. Oxygen was calculated by stoichiometry if needed. Indeed, quantification of oxygen by EDS is not reliable as its emitted X-rays have low energy and can be easily absorbed by the specimen or the detector window. The quantification of elements was carried out by Esprit software using a profile fit with standards and PhiRhoZ matrix corrections. The calculations are automated and require around 1h per frame. The results are expressed in atomic percent and saved in a numerical form. Custom MATLABâ¢ software was used to treat the data. For the anhydrous particulate specimens, background pixels are removed using a mask from a thresholded BSE image. The threshold value was found using the grey level histogram of the image. The remaining data is smoothed (see Appendix 1) and plotted in a ternary diagram for further analysis. Any of the quantified elements or their combinations can be used for the ternary plot, but in case of fly ashes the Al\u2013Si\u2013Ca system is typically of main interest. For each pixel the values of atomic-% of Al, Si and Ca are normalized to 100%, transformed to barycentric coordinates and plotted in a ternary diagram. As most of the compounds analysed were glasses it was preferred to plot the elements at the apexes rather than oxides. Although all the elements are oxidized, using the formula Al2O3 can be confusing when subsequently considering ratios of Al to Si, for example. If all the data points are plotted individually the ternary plot is saturated with millions of points and cannot be interpreted (Fig. 1A). Our solution is to re-plot it as a ternary frequency plot. The area of the ternary plot is split into smaller triangular areas (bins). The size was set so that one bin would span 1atomic-% on each of the three axes. Each axis is therefore divided into 100 equal sections and the resulting total number of bins is 10000. The number of points that fall into each bin creates a height vector for it. The height vectors of all bins are presented in form of a ternary frequency plot with linear colour intensity scaled to the maximum value of the height vector (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1 illustrates the two versions for the model sample containing two slags and one synthetic glass. The plot of all points (Fig. 1A) is not very informative, whereas the frequency plot (Fig. 1B) clearly shows the chemical compositions of the three constituents. The frequency plot allows an intuitive visual analysis of the distribution of chemical composition. Coordinates of points and areas in the ternary plot represent the proportions of Al, Si and Ca in atomic-%. Groups of similar chemical compositions appear as blobs in the graph and their relative proportions can be compared qualitatively from the height vectors. One can identify the number of the groups, their approximate chemical compositions and spread. One of the targets of the visual analysis is to define the ranges of chemical composition of the groups, which later serve as criteria for separation and quantification. Separation of phases of very close chemical compositions is possible. The compositions identified in the ternary plots can then be mapped back onto the original image, from which the amount of each phase in vol.% is calculated as its area fraction (Fig. 2 right), according to fundamental stereology (Delesse's principle). The accuracy of such quantification was assessed for the model sample by comparing with the known volume fractions of the materials used to prepare this specimen (Table 3). The maximum absolute differences between the expected and the calculated values were around 5vol.% for four frames analysed and around 3vol.% for eight frames analysed. A detailed error analysis is presented in Appendix 2. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 Characterization of a calcareous fly ash As an example, the analysis of raw FA2 is presented. BSE image reveals a complex microstructure and a multitude of phases distinguished by their grey levels (Fig. 3). The EDS data of the main elements of interest Al, Si and Ca is displayed with false colour attributed to each of these elements: red\u2014Al, green\u2014Si, and blue\u2014Ca (Fig. 4). One can identify groups of different compositions and some particles are composed of multiple phases. This heterogeneity is likely due to differences in composition of the source coal particles. These particles may contain different, mostly clay, minerals and as their combustion and cooling occur locally the melt does not undergo homogenization. Further, as calcareous fly ashes may contain large amounts of Ca, Mg, Na and K, the phase separation in glass, common in multi-component glass melts [11,40\u201342], could contribute to the microstructure complexity and heterogeneity of single glass particles. A first analysis of the ternary frequency plot for FA2 revealed that despite large overall scatter due to intrinsic heterogeneity, it was composed of several groups of phases readily distinguishable in the Al\u2013Si\u2013Ca ternary frequency plot (Fig. 5). The spread of the groups in the plot varies from small spots for well defined compositions to large regions covering ranges of compositions. The Si- and aluminosilicate-dominated groups are represented by high and narrow peaks, which suggest a reduced range of chemical compositions and large abundance. The Ca-rich alumino-silicate group has a diffuse shape of nonetheless high intensity. This phase or group of phases seems the most abundant in the fly ash but its chemical composition spans a large section of the ternary graph. Intermediate phases such as calcium-silicates with moderate Al and alumino-silicates with moderate Ca are well defined but present in lower amounts. Phases appearing at the 100% Ca corner typically include free lime (CaO), calcium sulfates and calcium carbonate (calcite). FA2 contains around 4wt.% C3A by XRD Rietveld analysis, which appears in the ternary frequency plot as a group below the calcium-rich aluminosilicate group. The hazy appearance of this group suggests that the C3A may be finely intermixed with other phases or may have formed inside glassy particles, whose composition was close to that of the C3A and favoured its formation. The quantity of non Ca\u2013Al\u2013Si phases such as iron oxides and magnesium oxide (periclase) is below 3wt.%, as determined by XRD-Rietveld (Table 2); they do not appear in the Ca\u2013Al\u2013Si diagram. To further investigate specific fly ash groups one has to define appropriate criteria for their selection. In this study the limits on Al, Si and Ca were sufficient to separate the groups but in different systems any of the quantified elements may be used and the selection may include more than three elements at once. The selection criteria for the groups should be rather wide to provide the necessary margin for often broad chemical compositions. Further, wide selection limits reduce the measurement error due to data scatter and potentially low content of the groups. For a more universally applicable description of fly ash composition, the selection criteria should cover most of the area of the ternary frequency plot. We propose a segmentation of the fly ash phases into four main groups, roughly corresponding to (1) mainly silicate, (2) calcium-silicate with low to moderate aluminium, (3) alumino-silicate with low to moderate calcium and (4) calcium-rich alumino-silicate (Fig. 6). Al-rich phases (>60atomic-% Al) are typically not encountered in fly ashes. Ca (>80atomic-% Ca) and Ca-Si (<10atomic-% Al) areas essentially contain crystalline phases such as free lime, calcium sulfates, calcite, C2S and C3S, which are assessed by XRD-Rietveld. The selection was carried out by applying limits on the content of normalized Al, Si and Ca atomic-% (Fig. 6, Table 4.). The resulting segmentation was considered reasonable as the segmented areas largely correspond to entire particles or major parts of particles. The chemical composition and microstructure of the groups identified in FA2 were investigated in more detail. Complementary (Na+K)\u2013Mg\u2013Fe graphs (Fig. 7) show that the composition of the groups 1, 3 and 4 is self-homogeneous and they do not need to be further divided into sub-groups. Due to low overall amount of group 2 its further separation, although possible, does not seem justifiable from a practical point of view. The complete average chemical compositions of the four groups are given in Table 5 . In the silicate and the aluminosilicate group, the relative proportion of alkalis to Mg and Fe is significantly larger than in the Ca-rich aluminosilicate and calcium-silicate group. However, in absolute terms, the alkali content of the silicate and the Ca-rich aluminosilicate groups is similar, but the latter contains more Mg and Fe. Mg seems to be more abundant in Ca-rich glasses and the content of Mg increases with Ca content, in the order of group 1<3<2<4. This is probably because Mg and Ca cations have the same charge and similar radii, which could facilitate their exchange or coexistence in glasses. Alkalis on the other hand, seem to follow an opposite trend and are present in larger amounts in glasses poor in Ca. An exception here is group 1, which contains almost only Si and only small amounts of other elements. Image overlays can be used to visualize the groups in the fly ash microstructure (Fig. 7). Combining chemical and morphological information allows a qualitative correlation of the glass chemical composition and the particle sizes. Ca-rich alumino-silicate glasses tend to form smaller particles while Si-rich and alumino-silicate glasses tend to form larger ones. Further, the size of particles may affect the cooling rate of the glass and thus the spread of chemical composition observed in the frequency plot. Small Ca-rich alumino-silicate particles may cool very quickly causing the chemical compositions to \u201cfreeze\u201d before phase separation occurs and leading to more spread ranges of chemical composition. Large particles are expected to cool down more slowly, allowing more pronounced phase separation or even devitrification and thus better defined blobs in the ternary plot. Indeed, the crystalline phases in fly ashes often exist inside the glass particles [43]. Hollow particles, cenospheres, are present in FA2. Although their actual mechanism of formation is not well understood [44], uniform Al/Si ratio of cenospheres found in various studies suggests [45] that certain glass compositions may favour cenosphere formation, notably that corresponding to anauxite, or kaolinite with excess silica. Practically all of the cenospheres in FA2 of this study belong to the aluminosilicate group, whose composition is the closest to that of kaolinite. 4.2 Application of the method to different fly ashes Ternary plots for all four fly ashes studied are shown in Fig. 8. They allow a quick visual comparison of the number and ranges of chemical composition of phases present in different fly ashes. Such comparison could also be applied to batches of the same ash to monitor its variability. In frequency plots the observed intensities are always relative to the largest height vector so direct visual comparisons should remain rather qualitative. Indeed, due to the presence of a single high peak from a not necessarily abundant phase but of a well defined composition other phases may appear as less prominent than is really the case. A convenient way to compare fly ashes is to use a common set of selection criteria to separate the phases into groups, as illustrated in Fig. 6, and compare their volume fractions. As most of the fly ash glasses are expected to form in the Al\u2013Si\u2013Ca\u2013Mg\u2013Fe\u2013alkali system or its subsystems, different fly ashes are likely to contain similar groups, although in potentially different proportions. Fig. 9 shows that these proportions can vary substantially depending on fly ash. While a siliceous fly ash FA4 is composed of aluminosilicates and silicates, higher calcium content in calcareous fly ashes results in the presence of additional calcium-bearing phases. An interesting subject is the distribution of calcium. According to the bulk chemical analysis (Table 1) calcium content in FA1, FA2 and FA3 is quite similar. However, the detailed chemical analysis shows that in FA1 calcium is mostly present in the large fraction of alumino-silicates with low to moderate-calcium. In FA2 and FA3 the dominant part is calcium-rich alumino-silicate, which is where most calcium is present. Simultaneously, a significant fraction of FA2 and FA3 is predominantly silicate and probably not very reactive. The actual reactivity of the identified groups is assessed in the next section. 4.3 Quantification of the degree of reaction of fly ash The reaction of fly ash is not characterized by a unique degree of reaction. Instead, different groups contribute to the overall reaction and it is essential to track the reaction of each of them separately. Each fly ash class can be extracted from hydrated cement paste following the same procedure as for raw fly ash (Fig. 10). However, in hydrated pastes, EDS maps contain both anhydrous and hydrated phases. Their Al\u2013Si\u2013Ca normalized chemical compositions can be very similar. To differentiate between the hydrates and the anhydrous phases a simple filter was applied. Assuming that each of the elements exists as its most common oxide, the stoichiometric oxygen was calculated and summed up for each pixel separately. Because hydrates contain water and hydrogen is not detected by EDS, the total amount of the quantified elements as well as the respective oxygen is lower compared to anhydrous phases. Pixels with less than 55atomic-% of the respective oxygen were assigned to hydrates and removed from further analysis. This threshold value was determined empirically and worked best for all the investigated mixes. The previously defined criteria were used to assign pixels into the fly ash groups. Noise filtering was carried out using an open (erode-dilate) morphological operation and a diamond shaped structuring element with 3-pixel distance from the structuring element origin to the points of the diamond. For each of the groups, the number of segmented pixels was related to the total number of pixels in the frame to give an area fraction (equivalent to volume fraction). The values at time zero were calculated from the proportions of Portland clinker, calcareous fly ash and water in the mix and their densities. In the case of group 4 (calcium-alumino-silicate), it was necessary to account for the overlap with the anhydrous C3A and C4AF phases from Portland clinker. The volume fractions of C3A and C4AF, unreacted at each time, were computed from XRD-Rietveld quantification and subtracted from the volume fractions of the group 4. To verify that such operation did not carry a significant error, a comparison between SEM-EDS and XRD was made. Quantification of C3S and C2S in PC\u2013FA2 mix showed only minor differences (Fig. 11). The unreacted volume fractions for each of the fly ash groups were calculated for Portland\u2013fly ash pastes at hydration times spanning from 1day to 365days (Fig. 12). The points were joined with lines to guide the reader's eye and facilitate visual assessment of the results. The overall trends are quite smooth as local fluctuations tend to cancel out, which raises confidence in the results and suggests that the observations made using this method are quite robust. Fig. 12 shows that the two investigated fly ashes contain significantly different proportions of the identified groups and that these groups clearly contribute differently to the reaction of fly ash. FA1 is mainly composed of aluminosilicates with low to moderate calcium content (70vol.%) and calcium-silicates with low to moderate aluminium (15vol.%), while in FA2 these two phases account together for only around 20vol.%. They react at a moderate pace and reach around 60% degree of reaction after one year of hydration. FA2 contains a significant amount of around 55vol.% of calcium-rich aluminosilicate phases, which in FA1 are only present in a small quantity, below 10vol.%. These calcium-rich aluminosilicates are the most reactive, exceeding 80% degree of reaction at 28days (FA2) and 56days (FA1) of hydration and contribute the most to the overall reaction of FA2. Indeed, Ca-rich glasses tend to be more reactive than those with moderate and low Ca contents [37]. Calcium acts as a modifier in the glass structure; breaking up SiO bonds it creates a network that is less connected and thus easier to break apart upon contact with solvents. Large amounts of highly reactive Ca-rich alumino-silicate glass could have an important impact on the hydration products of PC\u2013FA mixes, leading to formation of significant amounts of AFm and AFt phases. As these phases can interact with Clâ and SO4 2â ions from aggressive environments they may affect the durability of the binder. Large quantities of readily available alumina from the fast reacting Ca-rich alumino-silicate glass could potentially react with carbonates from limestone [46] and improve its reactivity in blended cement, which may subsequently allow larger clinker replacement. The strength development of PC\u2013FA mixes is likely to depend on the type and amount of calcium-bearing phases in fly ash. The influence of calcium was shown by Mehta [47] and indicated a clear trend to higher compressive strength with higher overall calcium content of fly ash. However, it did not take into account that a significant fraction of fly ash may be composed of almost non-reactive highly silicate phases. As shown in Fig. 12, one fifth of FA2 volume was such silicate. 5 Conclusions The technique presented here allows a quick visual determination of the groups of different chemical compositions constituting a complex material, here fly ash. The number of groups, their approximate chemical compositions and uniformity can be readily evaluated from the ternary plot. The identified groups can be used to produce a segmented image or be further analysed (chemical composition, relative volume fraction). With small adjustments, the presented methodology could be extended to other types of SEM-EDS data. Groups of different chemical compositions were identified and quantified in four different fly ashes. Analysis of their reaction in two selected Portland-fly ash pastes confirmed different contributions to the overall reaction. The proportion of the groups seems to have a crucial impact on the reactivity of the fly ash, which strengthens the view that fly ashes should not be judged by their bulk chemical composition only. Further work is under way to understand how different fly ash glasses react and influence the reactivity of other components in cement, the microstructure of the paste and the durability of the binder. More research is needed to investigate the reactivity of the fly ash groups in a broader range of fly ashes and in systems with other SCMs such as limestone and slag. Understanding of the fly ash composition, reactivity and effect on concrete properties is a challenge for cement research. The method presented here offers a tool that could facilitate investigations, lead to an improved classification and use of calcareous fly ashes in concrete or even enable predictions of their impact on this material.

Appendix 1 Quality of EDS data A reliable set of chemical composition data is key for a precise and accurate analysis. An important drawback of EDS is that the signal is collected from a volume of sample, several microns in size, called an interaction volume. Because of that, the proximity of epoxy resin or other particles of different chemical composition affects the measurement, and adds noise and uncertainty to the spatial resolution. To account for this effect the raw data was smoothed with a Hamming window (Fig. 13). This window belongs to a family of windows that reduce high frequency noise, but do not change the size and shape of the input. The size of the window was chosen to match the size of the interaction volume. The interaction volume was modelled using Monte Carlo simulation in Casino v2.41 software (www.gel.usherbrooke.ca/casino/index.html) for a bulk composition of FA2 and the parameters the microscope was operated at (Fig. 14). As the chemical composition is quantified for each pixel of the frame, the quality of the quantification depends primarily on the quality of the individual spectra. The quality of the individual spectra depends on the measurement conditions and can be evaluated by comparing the SEM-EDS results to bulk chemical composition by XRF. This was done for FA2 (Fig. 15). The EDS data was treated in two ways. Quantification of a spectrum taken collectively from the entire frame (EDS-1) showed that up to around 1.5atomic-% difference is related to the quality of standards, the way the spectrum is treated in the software and the errors involved, all of which are largely independent of the user. When individual spectra were quantified and the results averaged (EDS-2) the differences did not change. This suggests satisfactory quality of the individual spectra. It is difficult to evaluate all sources of errors of an EDS analysis and quantification. Due to sample-, microscope-, EDS detector- and data processing-related errors the combined uncertainty of quantification can be estimated around Â±1.5atomic-%. In practice, the chemical composition is represented by bin coordinates and each of the data points adds to a single bin. To account for the uncertainty of quantification an individual data point adds to multiple bins. The value of the increment varies as a function of the distance from the data point coordinates according to a specified distribution. In this study, the uncertainty of quantification was assumed to follow Gaussian distribution with 2Ï=1.5%. This operation adds spread to the frequency plots but the results more truly reflect the meaning of the data. Chemical resolution is limited by several factors. The uncertainty of quantification (Â±1.5%) sets the lowest limit. Particle edges and finely intermixed fractions, below the pixel size, are likely to share contributions to the measured chemical composition with their surroundings. Mixed contributions are plotted in the frequency plots between the original areas reducing precision of the separation and quantification. Fly ashes can have a very wide range of chemical compositions that add spread to the groups seen in ternary frequency plots. The extent of this effect depends on the heterogeneity of the investigated material. With no clear borders between the groups, segmentation may be impossible or may require arbitrary decisions of a skilled operator. Some issues may be resolved using additional refinements and adjustments, depending on the case. Appendix 2 Error analysis There exists no absolute measure of the error in general. Using a model system, the error for eight analysed frames was determined to be around 3vol.% (Fig. 16). In most cases the absolute values are unknown and a relative error analysis is carried out instead. For a certain quantity being assessed (e.g. volume fraction of a phase), one should prepare a log\u2013log convergence plot of the relative differences of the amount quantified in different frames against the number of frames, which is the usual way to assess convergence. One can then fit a trend line to the calculated points and use it to determine the number of frames required to reach a certain relative error. The size of the particles may influence the uncertainty. Fine or finely intermixed phases below the size of the interaction volume or the size of the minimum recognizable grain may be inseparable and thus not correctly qualified. In image analysis, a particle is reliably identified as such if its diameter is at least the size of two pixels and at most half the size of the field of view. Resolution and frame field of view in this study result in a pixel size of 0.246Ã0.246Î¼m. Particles of a mean diameter smaller than 2pixels (0.5Î¼m) or larger than 1/4 of the frame (90Î¼m) are thus not adequately identified. An independent measure of the particle size distribution (Fig. 17) shows that the fractions below 0.5Î¼m and above 90Î¼m account for less than 2\u20133vol.% each. For the investigated materials the resulting error is not expected to influence the results much. However, larger errors should be expected for materials of broad particle size distributions (e.g. a non-ground fly ash), which may require significantly more frames to reach similar levels of certainty. Shortening of the measurement by allowing less time per frame may jeopardize the reliability of the results and lead to false interpretations. Decreased magnification would lower the precision and the resolution. Optimization of the parameters may be required.

        "dc:description": "Calcareous fly ashes are high-potential reactive residues for blended cements, but their qualification and use in concrete are hindered by heterogeneity and variability. Current characterization often fails to identify the dominant, most reactive, amorphous fraction of the ashes. We developed an approach to characterize ashes using electron microscopy. EDS element composition of millions of points is plotted in a ternary frequency plot. A visual analysis reveals number and ranges of chemical composition of populations: silicate, calcium-silicate, aluminosilicate, and calcium-rich aluminosilicate. We quantified these populations in four ashes and followed their hydration in two Portland-ash systems. One ash reacted at a moderate rate: it was composed of 70vol.% of aluminosilicates and calcium-silicates and reached 60% reaction at 90days. The other reacted faster, reaching 60% at 28days due to 55vol.% of calcium-rich aluminosilicates, but further reaction was slower and 15vol.% of phases, the silica-rich ones, did not react.",
