Tel.: +1 530 898 5489. Sucrose and zinc oxide (ZnO) are effective cement hydration retarders. The goal of this study was to provide a new look into the ZnO cement hydration mechanism and to investigate impacts of various supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) on retardation behavior of ZnO and sucrose. Changes in the pore solution composition and reaction kinetics were measured for cementitious systems with ZnO or sucrose that contained rice straw ash (RSA), wheat straw ash, silica fume, metakaolin, and fly ash. Among the SCMs used, RSA dramatically suppressed ZnO and sucrose retardation. Experimental results indicated that the mechanism by which ZnO retards hydration reaction could be nucleation and/or growth poisoning of C-S-H. Reduced retardation of paste samples containing RSA was attributed to the ability of RSA to provide nucleation sites for C-S-H precipitation. This study provides a better understanding of the interaction between SCMs and cement hydration retarders essential in predicting retarder\u2013dose effects.

Retarders, as chemical admixtures, are used in concrete to increase the working time of the concrete, allowing for longer haul, placement, and finishing times. Sugars are well-known cement hydration retarders. Numerous researchers have studied the impact of sucrose (sugar) on cement retardation [1\u20135]. Although the mechanism by which sucrose delays cement hydration is not yet completely understood, several studies have proposed that sucrose retards cement hydration by slowing the formation of hydration products through poisoning nucleation sites for such products, e.g. calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) [3,6]. Sucrose does not prevent C-S-H growth permanently, though, because as the dissolution of cement continues, more ions enter the solution and more nucleation sites are produced. Eventually the number of these sites overcomes the poisoning abilities of the sucrose molecules. At this point, the hydration reactions proceed faster than the condition where no sucrose was added to the system. This has led sugars to be called \u201cdelayed accelerators\u201d [7]. It has been proposed that the high calcium concentration in the pore solution is the reason for this fast hydration reaction following the retardation period [3]. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is another hydration retarder that has been considered for use in some applications [8,9]. The mechanism by which ZnO retards cement hydration is proposed to be different than that of the sucrose. Arliguie and Grandet [10,11] proposed that in the presence of zinc ions in the pore solution, an amorphous layer of zinc hydroxide (Zn(OH)2) is formed on the surface of anhydrous tricalcium silicate (C3S) phase in cement. They also showed that the zinc retards the hydration of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) if the amount of SO3 in the system is more than 2.5%. They postulated that formation of the amorphous layer of zinc hydroxide on the surfaces of anhydrous cement grains isolates the cement particles from water and thus inhibits cement hydration. According to Arliguie and Grandet [10,11], once the concentrations of calcium and hydroxyl ions in the pore solution are high enough, the amorphous zinc hydroxide transforms into a crystalline calcium zinc hydroxide. Once this happens, the cement hydration reactions start again. Eqs. (1) and (2) show the suggested chemical reactions of ZnO in cement pore solution [8,12].

[13] showed that a crystalline phase of calcium zinc hydroxide was present in paste samples containing ZnO that were cured for 28days. However, there is no experimental evidence for the presence of a zinc hydroxide layer around cement particles, so this theory for the mechanism of the retarding action of ZnO remains unconfirmed experimentally. Supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as silica fume, slag, and metakaolin, can have a major impact on cement hydration kinetics [14,15]. SCMs can have a dilution effect at early ages and/or a seeding effect [2,14,16]. When using SCMs in cementitious systems, typically the amount of cement in the system is reduced and replaced by the SCM, effectively diluting the amount of cement in the system. As a consequence, the effective water\u2013cement ratio (w/c) is increased compared to a system without SCMs at the same water content. This provides more space for the hydration products, enabling the acceleration period of cement hydration to be extended because of additional space available for the reaction products to form [14]. This phenomenon is part of what is often called the \u201cfiller effect.\u201d Another aspect of the filler effect results from enhanced nucleation resulting from seeding provided by SCMs. Because of the seeding effect, the induction period of cement hydration can be dramatically reduced and hydration rate can be increased during the early period [2,16]. The reduction in the induction period is due to C-S-H precipitating faster on the nucleation sites provided by the SCMs than on the surface of cement grains [2,16]. SCM surface area reactivity and \u201cchemical affinity\u201d [16] are the primary factors that determine the ability of SCMs to provide nucleation sites for C-S-H precipitation [2,16]. C-S-H can also form because of the pozzolanic reaction between the silica-containing SCM and calcium hydroxide dissolved in the pore solution [2]. The formation rate of this C-S-H depends on the rate of pozzolanic reaction, which is unique to each SCM. The pozzolanic reaction rate can be enhanced when the amorphous silica content and surface area of the SCM are increased [17,18]. SCMs can interact with chemical admixtures used in concrete, especially set modifying admixtures. Taylor-Lange et al. [19] studied the impact of ZnO retardation on paste samples with and without metakaolin as a 15% replacement of cement. They showed that the retarding action of ZnO was significantly decreased by the presence of the metakaolin and attributed this behavior to the amorphous nature of the metakaolin used [19]. To the best of our knowledge, the influence of other SCMs on the retarding action of ZnO as well as the impact of SCMs on retarding action of sucrose have not been investigated. Given the variety of SCMs, understanding the interaction between SCMs and cement hydration retarders is essential in predicting retarder-dose effects. This paper investigated the retarding action of ZnO and sucrose on cement-based mixtures containing silica fume, rice straw ash, wheat straw ash, fly ash, or metakaolin SCMs. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanism(s) by which ZnO and sucrose retard cement hydration, leading to a better prediction of retarder dosage for various cementitious systems. Additionally, this work addresses whether or not the amorphous content of SCMs plays a role in decreasing retardation action of ZnO and sucrose. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials An ASTM C150 [20] Type I portland cement was used. The cement chemical composition, fineness, and potential composition calculated using the Bogue method outlined in ASTM C150 are shown in Table 1 . Undensified silica fume, Dynapoz metakaolin, Class F fly ash, metakaolin, wheat straw ash, and rice straw ash were selected as the SCMs for this study. Undensified silica fume was used to reduce agglomeration and to have higher surface area, compared to the commercially used densified silica fume. ACS grade zinc oxide and sucrose were used as hydration retarders. In order to produce rice straw ash (RSA) and wheat straw ash (WSA) with high amorphous content, high surface area, and low loss on ignition (LOI), the biomass (wheat straw and rice straw) was pretreated with 0.1N HCl (diluted from reagent grade HCl) at 80Â°C. 250g of biomass was immersed in 3100Â±100mL of 0.1N HCl solution in a 4000mL glass jar. The sample was stored undisturbed at a constant temperature of 80Â°C for 24h. The biomass was then rinsed twice, each time with 2500mL of distilled water, and dried at 80Â°C in an oven. To prepare the ash (WSA or RSA), a programmable electric muffle furnace was used to heat the biomass. 200g of dried biomass was fired in each batch. A stainless steel cage with two wire mesh shelves was used to hold the biomass during burning, and a stainless steel pan was placed below the cage to catch any ash that fell through the mesh. Finally, the ash was ground for 1h at 85 revolutions per minute (rpm) in a laboratory ball mill. WSA was prepared by burning the pretreated wheat straw at 650Â°C for 1h and is labeled as WSA650. Two types of RSA were prepared. RSA650 was obtained by burning pretreated rice straw at 650Â°C for 1h, and RSA500 was prepared by burning pretreated rice straw at 500Â°C for 2h. Chemical and physical properties of the SCMs are given in Table 2 . The following naming convention is used: OPC stands for a sample that does not contain any SCM; OPC+WSA650, OPC+RSA650, and OPC+RSA500 represent samples that contain 15% of WSA650, RSA650, and RSA500 replacement of cement, respectively. Similarly, OPC+MK, OPC+SF, and OPC+FA are samples that contain 15% of MK, SF, and FA replacement of cement, respectively. When ZnO or sucrose was used, it is indicated at the end of the sample name in parenthesis with the dosage, such as OPC+RSA500(0.15% ZnO). 2.2 Experimental methods 2.2.1 Material characterization Surface areas of samples were determined using BET nitrogen adsorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Surface Area and Porosimetry Analyzer. Samples were degassed before testing for 7h to 24h at 200\u2013400Â°C and at a pressure of 500Î¼mHg or less. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to (i) identify the primary and companion phases in each SCM material and, (ii) quantify the crystalline and amorphous content following Rietveld analysis. X-ray powder diffraction data were collected using a Siemens D500 Diffractometer with a 2200W copper-target X-ray tube, operating at 40mA and 30kV, with divergent and Soller slit details [21]. XRD scans used CuKÎ± radiation, over a scan range of 5Â° to 45Â° 2Î¸ in increments of 0.02Â° 2Î¸, and a 4s dwell time. Sample preparation included mixing 1.8g of the SCM sample with 0.2g of zinc oxide (used as an internal standard) and ethanol to create a slurry, followed by hand-grinding in a ceramic mortar for approximately 2min., and finally drying in a fume hood for 20min., prior to transferring into the sample holder. The internal standard, zinc oxide, was checked against corundum to verify 100wt.% crystallinity. (Note: this process was conducted independently of the zinc oxide used as a retarder; it is coincidental that the same material was usEd.) Identification of the primary and companion phases was performed using Jade analysis software (Materials Data, Inc.). The Rietveld method was used to obtain the amorphous content of each SCM [22,23]. The Rietveld method uses a least-squares, whole pattern-fitting structure refinement method, performed until the best fit is obtained between the observed and calculated diffraction pattern [24]. Theoretical crystal structures for each primary and companion mineral were taken from the literature and are shown in Table 3 . The analysis assumes that the theoretical parameters are representative of the actual structures. The least-squares fitting algorithm was used to accurately fit the experimental X-ray diffraction pattern from a range of 10Â° to 45Â° 2Î¸. The results provided the crystalline content of each identified mineral phase, with the mass percentage of the amorphous quantity obtained using Eq. ((3) [21]: (3) P amorphous % = Î£ i = 1 n P i I \u2032 I 100 100 â I \u2032 where, Pamorphous is the mass percent of amorphous material present in the sample, Pi is the mass percentage of the phase i as determined directly by Rietveld analysis, I\u2032 is the known mass percentage of the internal standard, in this case 10wt.% ZnO, I is the mass percentage of internal standard as determined directly by Rietveld analysis, and n is the number of total phases in the sample identified using the Jade analysis software. The Rietveld algorithm optimizes the model function by minimizing the weighted sum of the squared difference between the observed and computed intensity values [25]. Therefore, the refinement process for each SCM sample was evaluated with R-factor refinement criteria, including R-pattern (Rp ), R-weighted pattern (Rwp ) and R-expected (Rexp ) [24]. Rwp is the square root of the quantity minimized, scaled by the weighted intensities between the observed and computed algorithm. Rexp represents the \u201cbest possible Rwp \u201d quantity, such that Rexp is the smallest obtainable value of Rwp [26]. It is considered that R-values are best used as indicators of the progress of refinement [24] rather than on a comparative basis. All refinements were visually inspected to determine the quality of a Rietveld fit and ensure a plausible model. Amorphous contents of the SCMs were then calculated and are reported in Table 4 . The Rietveld method has been shown to have an error lower than 6% [27]. 2.2.2 Reaction kinetic measurements Retarding effects of ZnO and sucrose on cementitious systems were determined by measuring the heat of hydration of cement paste samples. 15% cement (by weight) was replaced with SCMs. A 0.45 water\u2013cementitious material ratio (w/cm) was used. Paste samples were mixed with an overhead stirrer (Heidolph Type RZR 1) at 500rpm for 90s, followed by a 120s rest period, and then mixed at 2000rpm for 120s. Paste samples of approximately 30g each were tested in an eight-channel isothermal calorimeter (W.R. Grace, AdiaCalâ¢ TC) at 23Â°C. To measure the retarding effects of ZnO, 0.15%, 0.3%, 0.5%, or 1% of ZnO by weight of total cementitious materials (portland cement plus SCM), was mixed with cementitious materials before adding water to the mix. When sucrose was used as a retarding agent, 0.15% by weight of total cementitious materials of sucrose was dissolved in the mixing water. To obtain the retardation time, the slope of the acceleration peak of heat of hydration was extended to the x-axis (time axis). The intersection point between the extended slope and x-axis was considered as the retardation time and reported in Table 5 . Three replicate tests were performed on a paste sample with 0.3% ZnO addition to estimate the error. The error, based on standard deviation, was Â±8% for the delay time and Â±3.7% for cumulative heat of hydration at 72h. 2.2.3 Pore solution analysis Pore solutions of fresh cement paste were obtained by vacuum filtering cement paste at several time intervals until setting. The solution was then analyzed for calcium and zinc concentrations using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-Model 720-ES ICP, Varian Australia Pty Ltd). To obtain unbound (free) sucrose in pore solution, total organic carbon (TOC) of the pore solution was determined using a TOC analyzer (TOC-L series, Shimadzu). The measurement error was less than 3% of the measured value and was estimated based on standard deviation of three replicate tests. 2.2.4 Zinc ions/sugar molecules sorption To determine the extent of sorption of zinc ions by SCMs, each SCM was mixed in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution in the presence of ZnO, without portland cement. A 0.1M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (initial pH of 13) was used to simulate the cement pore solution pH [28]. Zinc concentrations in these solutions were then compared with equivalent solutions without SCMs. To perform this experiment, 0.1g of ZnO and 5g of SCM were added to 15mL of NaOH solution in a 50mL plastic centrifuge tube (height=115mm, diameter=27mm). The ZnO/solution ratio was the same as ZnO/water for paste samples containing 0.3% ZnO, and the SCM/solution ratio was the same as in SCM/water for paste samples, resulting in a more dilute suspension rather than a paste due to the absence of cement. The tube was shaken vigorously by hand for 2min, followed by a rest period of 4h. The suspension was vacuum-filtered through a glass microfiber filter paper with 1.1Î¼m openings, and the filtrate was analyzed for Zn concentration using ICP-MS. Separate control samples were prepared without adding SCMs. Similarly, 0.05g of sucrose was dissolved in 15mL of NaOH solution (sucrose/solution ratio was the same as sucrose/water for paste samples containing 0.15% sucrose), and then 5g of SCM (SCM/solution ratio was the same as SCM/water for paste samples with 15% SCM) was added in the tube and the tube was shaken vigorously by hand for 2min, followed by a rest period of 4h. After filtration, the TOC of samples containing SCMs was compared to that of the sample without SCMs to determine the amount of sucrose adsorbed by SCMs. The measurement error, estimated based on standard deviation of three replicate tests, was 2.5% of the measured value. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 ZnO retardation of cement hydration Fig. 1 presents the impact of ZnO additions on the hydration rate of OPC. Zinc oxide strongly retarded the cement hydration. The retardation increased as the percentage of ZnO in the sample increased, with the induction period length reported in Table 5. ZnO also increased the peak height and narrowed the width of the main hydration peak, suggesting a more rapid rate of nucleation and growth. Fig. 2 demonstrates a linear correlation between the amount of ZnO added and both the retardation time and the height of main peak of hydration. Based on these data, ZnO acts as a \u201cdelayed accelerator\u201d in a similar fashion as that reported in the literature for sucrose [3\u20135]. Due to the increase in peak height after retardation, the 3day cumulative heat of hydration of samples containing ZnO was similar to OPC sample without ZnO, as shown in Fig. 1b. With similar 3day cumulative heat of hydration, independent of ZnO dosage, it can be expected that the compressive strength at 3days would also be similar for all samples [29]. Arliguie and Grandet [10,11] proposed that retardation caused by ZnO is due to an amorphous layer of zinc hydroxide that forms on the cement particles, inhibiting dissolution. If ZnO inhibits cement dissolution, then it would be expected to find lower concentrations of dissolved ions from the cement in the pore solution of pastes that contain ZnO relative to the ion concentrations from OPC pastes without ZnO. Fig. 3a shows the calcium ion concentration of pore solutions filtered from pastes, with and without ZnO. Calcium concentrations were similar for all pastes up until roughly 4h after mixing. Over the long induction period caused by ZnO additions, the calcium concentrations in OPC(0.3% ZnO) and OPC(0.5% ZnO) samples reached almost twice the calcium concentration shown in OPC samples at 4h (the time after which vacuum filtration was no longer possible for this sample due to setting). Therefore, the mechanism proposed by Arliguie and Grandet [10,11] is not validated by these experimental data; zinc oxide does not inhibit the dissolution of cement. In fact, zinc oxide results in an increase in the calcium concentration of the pore solution during the extended induction period, up until the time of set for these retarded systems. The amount of zinc oxide added to the system is directly correlated with the length of the retardation period, as shown in Fig. 2. The concentration of zinc ions in pore solutions vacuum-filtered from pastes was monitored to examine changes in concentration with time and ZnO dosage. Fig. 3b shows that for all three dosages of ZnO, the zinc concentration slowly increased in the pore solution until about halfway through the induction period and then gradually decreased. The increase in Zn ion concentrations at early times is clearly caused by ZnO dissolution. The reason for the reduction in the Zn concentration over time is less clear. The reduction may be caused by the precipitation of a calcium zinc hydrate phase (see Eq. (2)) or by the adsorption or chelation of Zn ions onto C-S-H nuclei. Notably, the Zn removal from the solution (from either process) could occur concurrently with the dissolution from ZnO and it is unknown if during the plateau periods (seen with higher ZnO dosage in Fig. 3b) these processes happen simultaneously at the same rate (or not at all). If the assumption is made that the processes of dissolution and removal happen concurrently, then the dissolution of ZnO continues past the point when the induction period has ended in the OPC-only sample. In the absence of ZnO, the rapid heat release (Fig. 1) in the OPC-only sample at the end of the induction period is due to the nucleation and growth of hydration products. In the presence of ZnO, the induction period is extended, which means that nucleation and/or growth of hydration products are delayed or blocked. It is inferred that the presence of Zn ions in solution is hindering this process. If we assume that Zn ions are \u201cpoisoning\u201d the hydration product nuclei through adsorption or chelation, a mechanism that has been suggested for retardation caused by sucrose [3], or because of the formation of a calcium zinc hydrate on the nuclei, and that the C-S-H nuclei start forming at the same time in all the systems studied (effectively at the end of the OPC sample induction period), then it is possible that the dissolved Zn ions could start poisoning the nuclei immediately as they form. With this premise, the sample with the least amount of ZnO added to the system will have the lowest amount of Zn ions that can dissolve and therefore the \u201cpoisoning period\u201d will be the shortest. This is due to the fact that the dissolved zinc will be depleted the most rapidly. In systems with the most ZnO added, the processes of dissolution and adsorption/chelation will happen simultaneously for a longer period, until the rate of Zn removal exceeds the dissolution and the Zn ion concentration in solution decreases. Retardation ends when there are not enough Zn ions in the solution to poison the continued formation of nuclei. At this point, there are an excess of nuclei (far more than in an OPC-only system) and an excess of calcium (Fig. 3a), so the process of C-S-H growth proceeds more rapidly than normal, resulting in the \u201cdelayed acceleration.\u201d 3.2 Impact of SCMs on ZnO retarding action Since the effects of ZnO on cement hydration seem to be associated with the nucleation and growth of hydration products and some SCMs provide nucleation sites for cement hydration product growth, the interaction of ZnO and SCMs is worthy of examination. Fig. 4a shows the heat of hydration results from a paste containing 15% replacement of cement with rice straw ash (RSA500) with and without ZnO additions. The rice straw ash slightly accelerated cement hydration in the absence of ZnO, demonstrating the seeding effect of RSA [2]. When ZnO additions were used in pastes with RSA500, the retardation caused by ZnO was dramatically reduced. Similar to the OPC samples shown in Fig. 1b, the 3day cumulative heat in OPC-RSA500 pastes was unaffected by ZnO addition as shown in Fig. 4b, although RSA500 increased the 3day cumulative heat compared to OPC alone, due to the seeding effect. Fig. 5 shows the retardation caused by the ZnO additions to paste samples containing silica fume, metakaolin, and fly ash. Although silica fume affected cement hydration similar to RSA 500 (Fig. 5a), accelerating the hydration rate, the silica fume did not reduce retardation by ZnO nearly as much as RSA500 did (Table 5). Metakaolin and fly ash affected cement hydration less than silica fume and RSA, and also did not affect ZnO retardation (Fig. 5b,c, and Table 5). For a given ZnO content, for example 0.3% shown in Table 5, the OPC+RSA500 sample showed the lowest retardation period followed by OPC+RSA650. It is worth mentioning that if ZnO had been added based on cement weight rather than total cementitious material weight, samples containing SCMs would have had less amount of ZnO and the retardation period for samples containing SCMs would have been reduced accordingly. In order to determine why ZnO retardation was affected differently by the various SCMs, the delay in induction period was compared with SCM characteristics. Table 4 shows the amorphous and crystalline contents of the SCMs as calculated by Rietveld quantitative X-ray diffraction. No correlation was found between retardation (delay) time and the amorphous content of the SCM. However, an inverse correlation between the BET surface area of SCMs (Table 2) and the retardation time was seen, as shown in Fig. 6 . It has been proposed that SCMs can have the capacity to absorb and/or adsorb chemical admixtures in cementitious systems [30,31], which may be related to their surface area and may be the mechanism for the interaction between SCMs and ZnO. To determine the impact of SCMs on dissolved zinc content in cement pore solution, dissolution of ZnO in 0.1M NaOH solution with and without the presence of SCMs was studied. The results revealed that the Zn concentration was lower in the NaOH solution in the presence of SCMs than in the absence of SCMs, as shown in Table 6 . Samples containing silica fume showed the lowest Zn concentration of 2.5ppm. Zn concentrations were similar in the samples containing MK or RSA500. The data suggest that either ZnO dissolution in NaOH solution was reduced by SCMs or Zn ions were absorbed or adsorbed onto surfaces of SCMs. If the retarding action of ZnO by SCMs was solely due to this reduction of zinc ions in solution, silica fume would have suppressed the retardation more than RSA500 and MK, since silica fume samples had the lowest dissolved zinc concentration. Additionally, paste samples containing RSA500 and MK would have shown similar reduction in retardation to each other. This, however, was not the case, as can be seen in Table 5. Therefore, it can be concluded that other mechanisms than a reduction of zinc ions in solution are involved in reduction of ZnO retarding effect by SCMs. In order to understand the reduction in retardation provided by RSA samples, a discussion of the impact of RSA samples on cement hydration is needed. SCMs with high surface areas, such as silica fume and RSA, can provide nucleation sites for C-S-H precipitation. Thomas et al. [2] suggested that C-S-H forming due to the pozzolanic reaction acts as a nucleating agent. Because amorphous content and surface area are essential factors in the pozzolanic reaction, they are also important factors in providing nucleation sites for C-S-H precipitation. An increase in nucleation sites is associated with an increase in the early rate of hydration and its accompanying heat evolution during the acceleration period [2]. The RSA made for this study, particularly RSA500, contained a high amount of amorphous silica and had a very high surface area. When used in cementitious systems, this material could be expected to provide nucleation sites for C-S-H precipitation. Increased rate of heat evolution of OPC+RSA500 and decreased induction period, shown in Fig. 4a, suggest that RSA500 provided nucleation sites during cement hydration. The influence of RSA on the retarding effect of ZnO in cementitious systems could be similar to the impact of C-S-H seeding on sucrose retardation. Thomas et al. [2] showed that C-S-H seeding reduced the retardation action of sucrose. They suggested that this reduction was because of an increase in nucleation sites provided by C-S-H seeding. The reduction in retarding action of ZnO in paste samples containing RSA samples could be because of an increase in nucleation sites due to addition of RSA. Although silica fume also provides nucleation sites [2], the amount of nucleation sites provided by RSA is expected to be more than that provided by silica fume. This is because the RSA used had higher surface area compared to silica fume. The surface area of WSA650 was lower than that of RSA500 but higher than that of silica fume. Consequently, the retardation time for paste samples containing WSA650 was longer than those containing RSA500 but shorter than those containing silica fume (Table 5). The high surface area of RSA increases the rate of pozzolanic reaction during early hydration, which is admittedly minimal at this point, but may be enough for a small amount of C-S-H to form on the SCM surface. High rate of pozzolanic reaction is associated with high speed of nucleation site production [2]. This, in turn, will increase the C-S-H precipitation and heat of hydration during early hydration. As can be seen in Fig. 7 , during the first 4h of hydration, the paste containing RSA500 had higher heat flow compared to the one with silica fume, demonstrating that RSA provides more nucleation sites compared to silica fume during early hydration, leading to a shorter induction period when added to cement pastes (with or without ZnO). The results from pastes with and without SCMs suggest that the mechanism by which ZnO retards hydration could be nucleation and/or growth poisoning of hydration products. 3.3 Sucrose retardation Since the mechanism proposed here for ZnO retarding action is similar to that proposed in the literature for sucrose, comparison experiments were performed with sucrose. Figs. 8 and 9 show the TOC and calcium concentrations in pore solutions vacuum-filtered from paste samples prepared with 0.15% sucrose. The TOC content of the sucrose solution used as mixing water was 1325ppm. The TOC content of pore solution was seen to decrease with time to a concentration of about 350ppm in the first 24h, where it plateaued. On the other hand, calcium content of the pore solution increased with time until about 24h, after which it decreased (Fig. 9). Notably, the Ca concentration in paste samples with 0.15% sucrose after 1h of hydration was higher than that of paste samples without retarder after 4h of hydration (Fig. 3a). This suggests that sucrose increased the rate of cement dissolution, as has been previously reported in the literature [5]. The changes in TOC content and calcium concentration of the pore solution after 24h suggest that the induction period may be ending near this time, since sucrose is no longer being adsorbed by hydration products and calcium is apparently precipitating from solution to form hydration products. However, looking back at the pore solution calcium concentrations for ZnO-retarded pastes, the calcium concentrations in these systems did not decline as the induction period ended (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, calorimetry shows that the induction period of paste samples containing 0.15% sucrose was much longer than expected from the pore solution data, (52h) (Fig. 10a). Another explanation for the changes in sucrose and calcium concentrations at 24h could be because the sucrose content in solution reached a limiting value, beyond which it could no longer chelate or adsorb to the nucleation sites of hydration products. At this point, calcium starts precipitating from solution to create new, unpoisoned nucleation sites, reducing the calcium concentration in solution to the concentration (~350ppm) where OPC pastes ended their induction period, taking 52h in the case of the paste with 0.15% sucrose. At this point, hydration proceeds rapidly because of renewed dissolution of cement and plentiful, unpoisoned nucleation sites. 3.4 SCMs' impact on sucrose retarding action To test whether SCMs reduce the retarding effect of sucrose like they did with ZnO, the impact of sucrose on cement hydration was determined on paste samples with and without SCMs, as shown in Fig. 10. The addition of 15% of MK in paste reduced the retardation time due to sucrose by 20h compared to the sample without SCMs, whereas the sample containing 15% fly ash had longer retardation compared to OPC sample, as shown in Table 7 . It is worth noting that if sucrose had been added based on cement weight rather than total cementitious material weight, samples containing SCMs would have had less amount of sucrose and the retardation period for samples containing SCMs would have been reduced slightly. Two mechanisms by which RSA could have reduced the retarding action of sucrose are proposed here. One possible mechanism is that RSA absorbs/adsorbs sucrose molecules and hence reduces the number of sucrose molecules available for nucleation poisoning. The second mechanism is that RSA could act as C-S-H seeds and thus increases nucleation sites for C-S-H, which leads to reduced retardation [2]. It is hypothesized that silica fume and metakaolin behave according to the same mechanism as RSA, but reduce retardation less because of their lower surface areas compared to RSA. To test if RSA adsorbed and/or absorbed sugar molecules, a sugar adsorption test was performed by dissolving the sucrose in 0.1M NaOH solution with a pH of 13 with and without SCMs added. TOC content measurements revealed that SCMs did not sorb sugar molecules because the total organic carbon amounts in solutions filtered from suspensions containing SCMs were slightly higher than in the pure sucrose-NaOH solution, as shown in Table 8 . (The higher TOC content of samples containing SCMs could be because of dissolution of organic carbon from the samples into the solution.) Therefore, the reduction in sucrose retarding action due to addition of SCMs is not because of adsorption and/or absorption of sugar molecules. Although SCMs did not sorb sugar molecules in sucrose-NaOH solution (Table 8), SCMs reduced sugar concentrations in pore solutions vacuum-filtered from pastes made with the same sucrose solution, Table 9 . The differences in these data suggest that the impact of SCMs on sucrose retardation action has to do with the interaction of the sucrose with the C-S-H nucleation sites created by the SCMs in the system. As shown in Table 9, addition of SCMs in pastes reduced the TOC content of pore solution compared to pore solutions of pastes without SCMs. After 4h of hydration, the TOC of the OPC+RSA500 sample's pore solution was only 25% of that of the OPC sample. Low concentrations of sugar molecules in paste samples containing SCMs, particularly RSA500, could be because of more nucleation sites available for C-S-H precipitation in these samples due to high surface area of SCMs. Therefore, availability of more nuclei in the system due to SCM addition helps surpass the poisoning effect of sugar molecules at a faster rate. A good correlation was seen between TOC of paste samples after 4h of hydration and the retardation time due to sucrose addition, as can be seen in Fig. 11 . This indicates that free sugar molecules in the pore solution play a vital role in hydration retardation. Although retardation of OPC+RSA500 caused by sucrose addition ended at around 2.5h, free sugar molecules still existed in OPC+RSA500 after 4h of hydration, see Table 9. This suggests that retardation will end once free sugar molecules have reached a specific concentration in the pore solution; this was also shown in Fig. 8. As discussed earlier, retarding action of ZnO was stopped after Zn ion concentration in the pore solution reached a specific level, depending on the mix properties. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mechanism by which ZnO retards hydration is similar to that of the sucrose, which is nucleation and/or growth poisoning. Also, it can be proposed that the mechanism by which SCMs (RSA, WSA, and silica fume) reduce retardation time is because of the ability of SCM samples to provide nucleation sites for C-S-H precipitation in cementitious systems. 4 Conclusions Hydration retardation of cementitious systems due to the addition of the retarding agents zinc oxide (ZnO) and sucrose was studied. Furthermore, the impact of SCMs on retarding action of ZnO and sucrose was investigated using four types of SCMs. Results indicated that the mechanism by which ZnO retards hydration reaction could be nucleation and/or growth poisoning of C-S-H. This contradicts a previously proposed mechanism for retardation action of ZnO, which suggested that the hydration was retarded due to an amorphous layer of zinc hydroxide covering cement grains and hindering dissolution. It was shown that some SCMs reduced hydration retardation caused by either ZnO or sucrose. The ability of the SCM to reduce the retardation was well-correlated with the SCM surface area as measured by nitrogen BET methods. Among the SCMs used, a rice straw ash, RSA500, dramatically reduced hydration retardation in paste samples when added as 15wt.% replacement of portland cement. This was due to the high surface area of RSA500, which provided a high number of locations for nucleation sites for C-S-H precipitation in cementitious systems. Based on these results one can definitely see that surface area of SCMs is a major factor to be considered in selecting dosage of retarders; the higher the surface area, the higher is the retarder dosage requirement. This paper paves the way for more research needed on retarder dosage prediction for concrete containing SCMs. Acknowledgments Funding for this study was provided by the National Science Foundation under award # CMMI-1030939 and CMMI-1030972.

The goal of this study was to provide a new look into the ZnO cement hydration mechanism and to investigate impacts of various supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) on retardation behavior of ZnO and sucrose. Changes in the pore solution composition and reaction kinetics were measured for cementitious systems with ZnO or sucrose that contained rice straw ash (RSA), wheat straw ash, silica fume, metakaolin, and fly ash. Among the SCMs used, RSA dramatically suppressed ZnO and sucrose retardation. Experimental results indicated that the mechanism by which ZnO retards hydration reaction could be nucleation and/or growth poisoning of C-S-H. Reduced retardation of paste samples containing RSA was attributed to the ability of RSA to provide nucleation sites for C-S-H precipitation.
