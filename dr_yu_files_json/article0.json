Highlights \u2022 We characterize pure coal, coal and biomass co-fired, and pure biomass ash. \u2022 We examine physical, thermal, chemical and mineralogical characteristics. \u2022 Up to 15% biomass co-firing with coal does not significantly change the fly ash physical and chemical characteristics. \u2022 Co-fired ash that meets ASTM requirements for concrete can be used like coal ash. \u2022 Biomass ash can likely be used as sorptive agents or as a fuel supplement. Productively reusing the waste residuals from energy production is an essential component in sustainable disposal and management of energy related waste. In the US, the world\u2019s second largest producer of coal next to China, over 118 million tons of coal combustion by-products are produced each year; only 44% of which are productively reused. In recent decades, advances in lowering CO2, SOX, and NOX emissions from coal combustion have changed the characteristics of the solid coal combustion products. In particular, the residual carbon content of fly ash generated at many US coalfired power plants has increased, and has become more heterogeneous. Additionally, utilities are exploring the use of pure biomass as a fuel source, which results in a fly ash that is generated from a purely organic source. While much research effort has been devoted to understanding the properties and potential productive reuse alternatives for coal combustion products, relatively little research has been done on the byproducts from biomass combustion or co-combustion. In this study, high carbon content coal ash, co-fired coal/biomass ash, and pure biomass ash from several US power plants were investigated. The ashes were characterized using a number of physical and chemical analysis techniques, including: scanning electron microscopy, laser diffraction, organic carbon content, nitrogen adsorption surface area, proximate and ultimate, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Results showed little physical, chemical, and mineralogical differentiation between coal ash and coal co-fired with biomass ash. However, the pure biomass ashes investigated in this study, showed significantly lower specific gravity, and primary oxide content, as well as coarser particle size distribution, higher residual carbon, higher heating value, and much higher specific surface area, when compared to the coal and co-fired ashes. These results have important implications on the potential for productive reuse of these waste materials. Keywords Coal combustion ash Biomass ash Co-fired Residual carbon Productive reuse 1 Introduction Slightly more than 118 million metric tons of coal combustion by-products are produced in the US every year, only 44% of which are productively reused [1]. Fly ash, the fine particulate residual material generated from coal combustion, is produced at a rate of just over 54 million tons annually in the US [1]. The majority of this waste material is currently disposed of in impoundments on site at utilities or landfilled offsite, while 38% of fly ash is productively reused; predominantly as supplementary cementitious material (SCM) in the concrete and concrete products sector [1,56]. In 1990, an amendment to the Clean Air Act mandated a conversion to more environmentally friendly and renewable energy production in the form of low NOX combustion processes, in addition to longstanding CO2 and SOX emissions restrictions. This conversion to low emissions combustion can be achieved by techniques like: flu gas recirculation, low excess air operation, coal blending, and staged combustion [23,24]. All of these techniques alter ambient gas concentrations and/or lower boiler temperature, producing fly ash with coarser particle size distribution, lower amorphous glass content, and most importantly, higher and more inconsistent carbon content [17,21,23,24,25,30,51]. Increased residual carbon content in fly ash reduces the marketability of this waste product as SCM in concrete. The residual carbon adsorbs air entraining agents (AEAs) added to concrete to produce stable air voids to mitigate freeze\u2013thaw cracking [6,20,30,36,37]. Along with the low emissions strategies being implemented at modern power plants, sole combustion or co-combustion of waste biomass with coal has also become an attractive option for renewable and environmentally friendly energy production [14,33,53]. This biomass is typically in the form of chipped tree limbs, wood chips, and saw dust from urban, industrial, and agricultural sources. It is generally accepted that renewable energy generates zero net greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time offsetting those from fossil fuel combustion [26,47,52]. In addition to the environmental benefits of biomass combustion or co-combustion for energy, mixing of biomass with coal in typical combustion processes is a simple and relatively inexpensive procedure. It is thus a particularly appealing option for power plants [2]. Understanding the physical and chemical properties of fly ash produced at power plants is necessary for improving existing productive reuse and disposal methods, as well as for developing new alternatives for both reuse and disposal of this abundant waste stream. In the US, the concrete and concrete products sector accounts for just over 21% of total coal combustion product (CCP) productive reuse, consuming 11 million tons of fly ash annually, making this the largest fly ash reuse sector [1]. The ASTM C618 standard governs the use of fly ash in concrete, allowing only fly ash from 100% coal combustion, with loss on ignition levels below 6% (by mass), to be used in such applications. There are additional chemical composition and physical requirements for the use of ash as SCM; however, the two ASTM C618 restrictions mentioned above eliminate a large portion of fly ash produced today from potential reuse in concrete applications. The use of co-fired ashes with acceptable LOI, chemical and physical characteristics is not addressed in the current ASTM C618. As regulating bodies continue to reduce the allowable levels of SOX, NOX, and CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of utilities interested in transitioning from coal only combustion, to co-firing coal and biomass [55]. While a great deal of research on CCPs has been conducted over the past half century, relatively little work has been done on fly ash from this modern era that is seeking enhanced renewable energy resources. Research on the physical, chemical, and potentially beneficial characteristics of this ever evolving waste stream must continue. In this study, we aim to determine any differences between pure coal ash and biomass co-fired with coal ash, as well as pure biomass ash, through in-depth physical, chemical, and mineralogical characterization. Emphasis is placed on identifying potential productive reuse alternatives for these waste materials. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Sixteen ash samples from eight different power plants located in the eastern US were investigated in this study. Table 1 shows the location and operating capacity of each plant; along with the respective pulverizing processes, boiler configurations, and types of ash received. Table 2 shows the feed coal and biomass content for each ash sample. Plant CP1 coal ash was included as a reference high quality, low loss on ignition (LOI) Class F ash (ASTM C618), which is commercially marketed for use as SCM. The ASTM C618 criteria for the different fly ash class designations are summarized in Table 3 . As shown in Table 2, three samples were received from each of Plants CP2, 3, 4, and 5. The first ash sample from each plant was from the pure coal ash produced at that plant. The second and third ash samples were from biomass co-firing tests conducted at each plant. The samples from Plants BP1, 2, and 3 were pure biomass ashes from combustion of mill waste, logging, or urban wood waste without any coal. All pure coal ash samples were collected from dry storage silos after electrostatic precipitation (ESP). The co-fired fly ash samples were collected directly from hoppers at the electrostatic precipitators after the conclusion of each co-firing test. The pure biomass ashes were all obtained from storage silos after cyclone collection and electrostatic precipitation. All ash samples were provided by Southern Company. 2.2 Experimental methods Particle size distribution (PSD) was determined by dry dispersion laser diffraction (Sympatec GmbH, Rodos T4.1) for coal and co-fired ash samples. Dry sieving was used for pure biomass ash samples as their particle sizes were outside the measuring range for laser diffraction. A stack of 20 individual sieves from a #4 (4.75mm openings) to #400 (37Î¼m openings) was used. Specific gravity for all samples was measured by kerosene displacement in triplicate (ASTM C188). Bulk sample specific surface area was determined by liquid nitrogen adsorption (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020) using BET theory. Scanning electron microscope images were obtained on a LEO 1550 field emission SEM. Proximate analysis was conducted in accordance with the ASTM D7582 by thermogravimetry (Leco TGA-601). Ultimate analysis was conducted on a CHN analyzer (Perkin Elmer 2400 Series II), and a total sulfur analyzer (Leco S-144DR) following ASTM D3176. Heating value was determined by bomb calorimeter (Leco AC-350). In addition to the total carbon content from ultimate analysis, residual organic carbon content (ROC) was also measured with a Shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-Vcpm) with a solid sample module (SSM-5000A). Major elemental composition (expressed as oxides) was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry (Philips PW 2400). Mineralogy for all 16 ash samples was determined by random powder X-ray diffraction (PANalytical X\u2019Pert PRO). All samples were oven dried at 110Â°C for a minimum of 1h before analysis. The coal and co-fired ashes were analyzed without any particle size reduction. Pure biomass ash samples however, were ground to fine powder using mortar and pestle prior to analysis. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Physical characteristics Eleven major morphological fly ash particle groups have previously been categorized in terms of shape (angular, amorphous, rounded, spherical, vesicular, lacy) and opacity (non-opaque, mixed, and opaque) [15]. These morphologies can be observed in essentially all the coal ash samples tested in this study. To distinguish between the four different fly ash types considered in this study (LCFA, HCFA, CBFA, PBA \u2013 see Table 1), four general morphological classes were determined. Fig. 1 (a\u2013d) shows SEM images for each of these morphologic groups. Typical glassy aluminosilicate spherical particles, including cenospheres (hollow spheres) and plerospheres (spheres filled with spheres), found in a commercial LCFA (Fig. 1a); amorphous and porous unburned carbon particle from incomplete coal combustion surrounded by spheroids (Fig. 1b); carbon-rich fraction of CBFA generated by dry triboelectrostatic separation, which is a common fly ash beneficiation technique (Fig. 1c) [5,7,8,9]. The same type of unburned coal particles present in Fig. 1b were observed in Fig. 1c, along with a larger, more fibrous, woody particle from the biomass. Such fibrous and woody particles were the only particles observed in PBA (Fig. 1d). The particle size distributions (PSDs) for coal and co-fired ash were obtained by laser diffraction in air, while the biomass ash results were produced by dry mechanical sieving (Fig. 2 ). From literature, the majority of coal fly ash is typically finer than the standard number 200 sieve (75Î¼m openings), and is evenly distributed over a relatively wide range of particle sizes from greater than 200Î¼m to less than 1Î¼m [19,41]. Results show that the PSD for coal and co-fired ashes in this study are in line with these trends. The median particle size (D 50) ranged from 11.4Î¼m to 29.9Î¼m for the coal and co-fired ash samples, compared to 168Î¼m to 1440Î¼m for the biomass ash as shown in Table 4 . Coefficients of uniformity (CU = D 60/D 10) ranged from 6.3 to 35.47 for all 16 samples, indicating a distributed range of particle sizes for each of the ashes investigated. No consistent particle size distribution trend existed between pure coal and co-fired ash samples produced from the same plant. In some cases, the pure coal ash was finer than the co-fired ash produced from same boiler, while in other cases, the opposite trend was observed. In general, particle size distribution was relatively consistent for fly ash samples from the same boiler, and was largely unaffected by quantities of up to 15% co-fired biomass by energy. All biomass ash samples were significantly coarser than the coal and co-fired ashes, and showed more variability in their particle size distribution. Specific gravity (Gs ) values ranged from 2.15 to 2.63 for the coal and co-fired ashes and 1.03\u20131.87 for the biomass ashes (Table 4). ROC varied from approximately 1% to 14% for coal and co-fired ash samples, and from 22% to 80% for pure biomass ash. A trend of decreasing specific gravity with increasing ROC was evident (Fig. 3 ). Values for coal ash Gs from literature typically range from 2.0 to 3.0: however, for individual particles, Gs values can vary from less than 2.0, like in residual carbon, to 4.0 in iron rich spinels like magnetite and franklinite [3,28]. For the coal and co-fired ashes, specific surface area (As ) ranged from 1.27 to 9.15m2/g. For the pure biomass ash samples, As values were notably higher and varied over a much wider range, from 116 to 687m2/g. No trend was observed when comparing As for the pure coal and co-fired ash samples from the same boiler. In some cases, As decreased slightly with co-firing, and in other cases As increased slightly. In general, a trend of increasing ROC with As was observed for all ash samples (Fig. 4 ). There was, however, a stronger positive correlation between ROC and As for the pure biomass ash samples compared to the coal and co-fired ashes. Specific surface values for coal fly ash can vary from less than 1m2/g to 10m2/g, depending mainly on residual carbon content, with particle size distribution playing a less significant role [3,27,41,50]. Fig. 5 shows ROC and As results for different particle size fractions for ash samples CP4-1, 2, and 3. The ash samples were separated into seven particle size fractions using six sieves (178Î¼m, 152Î¼m, 75Î¼m, 44Î¼m, 37Î¼m, and 25Î¼m openings). For each fraction, ROC and As were determined. ROC decreased as particle size fraction decreased, from close to 50% organic carbon in the fractions retained on the 177Î¼m sieve, to 2% organic carbon in the fractions passing the 25Î¼m sieve. Other researchers have also shown that carbon content decreases while amorphous silica(glass) content increases with decreasing particle size in fly ash [10,19]. As also decreased with decreasing particle size from over 20m2/g for the fractions retained on the 177Î¼m sieve, to less than 5m2/g for the fractions finer than 25Î¼m. As should theoretically increase as particle size decreases since it is inversely proportional to the smallest dimension of a particle [40]. The presence of well developed internal porosity in the residual carbon particles, which became less prominent as particle size decreased, was the most likely source of the increased surface area. Similar results were observed for ash samples from plants CP2, 3, and 5 (data not shown). Schure et al. [41], conducted similar testing on two different ash samples, and also attributed higher than expected specific surface values in the larger particles size fractions to the presence of highly porous carbonaceous particles [41]. Further indication of the presence of internal porosity in the larger particle size fractions and the lack of porosity in the smaller particle size fractions, can be observed in nitrogen sorption\u2013desorption isotherms for particle size fractioned sample CP4-2, shown in Fig. 6 . The four largest particle size fractions produced Type IV isotherms (Fig. 6a\u2013d) as defined by the IUPAC [34,42]. The two smallest particle size fractions (Fig. 6e\u2013f) produced Type II isotherms. Fig. 7 shows the shapes of the basic IUPAC isotherm types [42]. Type II isotherms are generated by non-porous or macroporous adsorbents (pore diameters larger than 50nm), and they indicate unrestricted monolayer and multilatayer adsorption [34,42]. Type IV isotherms are indicative of mesoporous adsorbents (pore diameters between 2 and 25nm), and are similar to Type II isotherms in their adsorption leg, with a hysteresis loop in the desorption leg [34,42]. The hysteresis is caused by capillary condensation in the mesopores at high P/P 0 values [34]. In Fig. 6, the largest particle size fraction, retained on the 178 micron sieve, showed the most pronounced hysteresis loop, and thus contained the most developed mesoporosity. The hysteresis decreased progressively as particle size decreased until virtually no hysteresis was observed in the smallest particle size fractions. Similar results were obtained for the other CP4 ashes, CP4-1 and 3, (data not shown). 3.2 Chemical and mineralogical characteristics 3.2.1 Proximate, ultimate analysis, and heating value Proximate and ultimate analysis, as well as higher heating value (HHV) measurements, were conducted on all 16 ash samples. The results are shown in Table 5 , and clear difference between the pure biomass ash and the coal and co-fired ash samples can be observed. The biomass ash samples showed significantly higher moisture content, volatile matter (VM), fixed carbon (FC), total carbon (C), sulfur (S), and hydrogen (H); and lower ash content. Comparing the coal and co-fired ashes, there was little differentiation between the pure coal and co-fired ash samples from the same boiler. Overall, the proximate and ultimate results were very similar for ash produced at the same boiler. The differences between ash samples from different boilers can be attributed to variations in the composition of source coals, grinding and fuel preparation procedures, as well as combustion and ash collection conditions. Moisture and total carbon content were positively correlated for both the coal and co-fired ash samples (R 2 =0.788), and the biomass ashes (R 2 =0.990) (Fig. 8 ). As carbon content increased, surface area increased as well, due to the internal porosity of the residual carbon (previously discussed), resulting in more surface area available for hygroscopic moisture sorption. There was also a very strong correlation between HHV and FC for the coal and co-fired ash (R 2= 0.899), and the pure biomass ash samples (R 2 =0.953) (Fig. 9 ). One additional data point was plotted for reference, representing the average HHV and FC for 11 fuel-grade petroleum coke samples from a cement kiln at a plant in Cupertino, California was plotted (provided by Heidelberg Technology Center, Norcross, Georgia). Predicted HHV for all 16 ash samples using FC and volatile matter (VM) from proximate analysis using the empirical correlation: HHV=0.1905VM+0.2521FC [57], were also plotted. The predicted HHV values match the measured results relatively well. Measured HHV for the BP3 sample (25.36MJ/kg) was the closest to the measured HHV for fuel grade pet coke (32.68MJ/kg). Sample BP3 is thus a particularly strong candidate for productive reuse as an alternative fuel source for industrial processes like in cement kilns [4], or potentially in fired clay brick production [12]. 3.2.2 Major elemental composition Fly ash, is composed primarily of approximately 90\u201399% inorganic matter, consisting mainly of oxides of silicon, aluminum and iron; with lesser inclusions of magnesium, sulfur, titanium, phosphorous, potassium, sodium, and manganese [3,19,32,50]. In trace quantities, a wide variety of heavy metals like arsenic, lead, zinc, selenium, chromium and manganese can also be detected in coal fly ash [50]. Major element composition (expressed as oxides) from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, and loss on ignition (LOI) for the 16 ash samples (Table 6 ) were determined and compared with a database of similar results from literature. The bulk of the database content was from a study by McCarthy (1989) (178 fly ash samples), which consisted of major element composition and LOI data points for fly ash samples from US power plants. The complete data base (224 fly ash samples) includes 114 Class F, 102 Class C, and 8 non-specified fly ash samples from the US, Europe, India, and Australia [16,18,32,43,44,48,49]. The relationship between Ca, S, Mg, and LOI (respectively) vs. primary oxide content (POC=SiO2 +Al2O3 +Fe2O4) is shown in Fig. 10 . Values from the literature database are plotted together with the values for all 16 ash samples used in this study. All 13 coal and co-fired ash samples investigated plotted in the Class F (ASTM C618) region, with low CaO, SO3, and MgO content. The database of coal ash samples from literature showed a general trend of decreasing CaO, SO3, and MgO (respectively) with increasing POC. The decreasing CaO content with increasing POC was the most pronounced, ranging from close to 30% in the class C ashes to less than 1% in the Class F region. Class F ashes from the literature database showed the highest variability in CaO, SO3, MgO and LOI. In general, the Ca in fly ash tends to associate more with Mg, S, and P, and not with the aluminosilicate minerals and glass phases [10,19,22,29,31,32,39,43,50]. Fig. 10d shows consistently low LOI values (below 2%) in the Class C region for the coal ash samples from literature. In the Class F region, LOI values increased, and became highly variable for both the literature database and the data points from the samples in this investigation. The coal and co-fired ash samples from CP2, 3, 4, and 5 showed decreasing LOI with increasing POC within the Class F region. From literature, LOI and residual organic carbon content (ROC) values are typically higher for low calcium and sulfur content fly ash types (predominantly class F), owing to their higher rank coal origins [32]. Lower rank coals, which are typically richer in both Ca and S, are younger and thus less compacted and dense, and easier to burn, thus producing less ash and lower residual carbon content [32]. Adequate grinding and boiler efficiency is more important when higher rank coals are burned, and these factors can vary significantly from plant to plant, explaining the increase and the variability of LOI in the class F ashes. The results showed no consistent differences in major elemental composition and LOI between the coal and co-fired fly ash samples used in this study. However, the pure biomass ashes had significantly lower POC than the coal and co-fired ashes, plotting in the non-specification section. These biomass ash samples also had relatively low SO3 and MgO content, and variable CaO content from above 20% in BP1 to less than 2% in BP3. Researchers have shown that, the most common elemental constituents in biomass ash are typically Ca and K with lesser Mg, Na, Ma and Fe. Silicates, oxalates and sulfates are common anions in biomass ash as well [13]. Compared to coal ash, however, biomass ash is typically less enriched in silica, aluminum, iron and sulfur. The XRF results for the three biomass ash samples from this study are in agreement with these trends. In practice, LOI is often considered equivalent to ROC; however, this is not always the case. It has been demonstrated that fly ash from low rank coals typically shows significant disagreement between LOI and ROC, while ashes from high rank coals have minimal disagreement [11,50]. Residual carbon may be present in fly ash in both organic and inorganic (mainly CaCO3) forms. LOI will include the mass loss from both of these carbon sources, as well as from other volatile components that may be present in the ash, such as CaOH2 in the form of the mineral portlandite, which is commonly present in fly ash [11]. Thus, ashes with high Ca content typically show the largest discrepancy between LOI and ROC values [50]. This trend was observed in this study, where the two biomass ash samples BP1 and BP2 with Ca contents of 24.12% and 14.47%, respectively, showed significant deviation from the 1:1 line (Fig. 11 ). BP3 had Ca content of only 1.16%; however this sample (as with BP1, and 2) was also composed of other non-carbon volatile matter, which contributed to the LOI (Table 5). It should be noted that while the majority of the co-fired ash samples had high LOI (above the 6% ASTM limit), the results showed no correlation between LOI (or ROC) and the addition of biomass (up to 15% by mass) to the feed coal. The LOI or ROC of a particular co-fired ash was very similar to (sometimes even less than) the pure coal ash produced at the same boiler. The co-fired ashes produced at Plant CP2 (CP2-2, 3), each with 5% biomass and LOI below 3%, are thus excellent candidates for productive reuse as SCM, like the pure coal ash produced from the same plant. Furthermore, in situations where air entrained concrete is not required (e.g.: interior walls and slabs, and exterior walls in warm climates where freeze\u2013thaw cycles are not expected), high LOI co-fired ash can be used similar to coal ash as SCM, provided all other ASTM requirements are met. Vassilev et al. [47] have shown that compared to coal ash, pure biomass contains phases with more oxygen-containing functional groups like hydroxyl, carboxyl, ether, and ketone groups with highly reactive functionalities (\u2013COOH, \u2013OCH3 and \u2013OH) [47]. Biomass ashes are also more likely to contain chelates, light hydrocarbons, carbohydrates, oxyhydroxides, carbonates, chlorides, and phosphates; and less aromatic carbon species which are predominant in coal [35,47]. Biomass also generally contains more of the alkali and alkaline elements (K, Na, Mg, Ca) and chlorine than coal, which have been shown to cause boiler fouling or slagging during combustion [2,38,45,54]. These trends from literature are consistent with the higher alkali content measured in the three biomass ashes in this study, compared to the coal and co-fired ash samples (Table 5). Water soluble alkalis in biomass ash have been shown to interact unfavorably with air entraining agents (AEA) in concrete, thus increasing AEA demand and limiting the potential for productive reuse of some forms of biomass ash in concrete [45]. 3.2.3 Mineralogy Depending on the sensitivity of the measuring technique, almost all known natural elements can be detected in coal [35]. Several dozen detrital and authigenic minerals formed from these natural elements have been found in coal ash; the majority of which, however, are only present in trace quantities. The most prominent fly ash minerals are from 5 groups: silica, aluminosilicates, carbonates (calcite), sulfides, and chlorides [19]. XRD patterns for coal and co-fired ash samples from plant CP1, and CP5 showed that the predominant crystalline phases present in the coal and co-fired ash samples analyzed in this study were quartz (SiO2), mullite (Al6Si2O13), hematite (Fe2O3), and magnetite (Fe3O4) (Fig. 12 ). XRD patterns for the other coal and co-fired ash samples demonstrated similar trends (data not shown). In all cases, a distinct \u201chump\u201d in the XRD pattern from approximately 18Â° to 35Â° 2 Theta was observed. This broad peak is very common in fly ash XRD studies, and is referred to as the amorphous rise (or hump), due to the poorly ordered atomic structure of the glassy (amorphous) component of coal fly ash [10,46]. The results showed no significant change in the mineralogy of the resulting fly ash with co-firing of coal with up to 15% biomass. XRD results for the 3 biomass ash samples demonstrated that calcite (CaCO3), arcanite (K2SO4), and silica (SiO2) were the dominant mineral species identified in these ashes (Fig. 13 ). The mineral component in sample BP1 was predominantly calcite with minor arcanite. Sample BP2 was also mainly calcite, with a minor silica component. For sample BP3, the only identifiable mineral phase was silica. The vast majority of the material in BP3 was organic carbon, which is not identifiable by XRD. As in Fig. 10, these XRD patterns are shown without removal of the background; and as such, the lack of an amorphous rise in any of the biomass ashes confirms observations from SEM analysis (Fig. 1) that they did not contain very much (if any) amorphous glass. The lack of any aluminosilicate or iron oxide minerals in the biomass ash also corroborated the XRF results (Table 6). 4 Conclusions This study compared morphology, physical and chemical characteristics, and mineralogy of high carbon Class F coal ash, biomass co-fired with coal ash, and pure biomass ash from different US power plants. The pure coal and co-fired ashes were very similar morphologically, except the co-fired ashes contained a minor component of unburned woody particles not present in the pure coal ash. Pure biomass ash had significantly different morphology from the coal and co-fired ashes, consisting solely of fibrous, woody char particles and no evidence of the typical cenospheres found in fly ash. The specific surface area of the coal and co-fired fly ash samples was controlled by internal porosity in the residual carbon content, which decreased as particle size fraction decreased, resulting in a decrease in specific surface area as particle size fraction decreased. There was no indication that co-firing biomass with coal changed the overall residual carbon content of the ash samples. With up to 15% (mass) biomass co-firing, the ash produced at a particular boiler remained relatively unchanged, in terms of residual carbon, particle size, major elemental composition, and mineralogy. This suggested that ash from co-firing of coal with up to 15% biomass could be productively reused in concrete as supplementary cementitious material in much the same way as pure coal ash, provided this ash meets all the other required ASTM C618 criteria. The pure biomass ash samples examined in this study were significantly different from coal ash. Unlike coal ash, biomass ash did not contain aluminosilicate glass cenospheres, and was composed solely of large fibrous woody remnants with elevated alkali content compared to coal ash. These forms of ash will not likely be usable in concrete applications as SCMs due to their unsuitable chemical and physical characteristics. However, the relatively high carbon content, surface area, and higher heating value of these ash samples, warrant investigating their utility as sorptive agents, and potentially as fuel supplements in energy production or in industrial applications like clay brick firing and cement kilns.

        "dc:description": "Productively reusing the waste residuals from energy production is an essential component in sustainable disposal and management of energy related waste. In the US, the world\u2019s second largest producer of coal next to China, over 118 million tons of coal combustion by-products are produced each year; only 44% of which are productively reused. In recent decades, advances in lowering CO2, SOX, and NOX emissions from coal combustion have changed the characteristics of the solid coal combustion products. In particular, the residual carbon content of fly ash generated at many US coalfired power plants has increased, and has become more heterogeneous. Additionally, utilities are exploring the use of pure biomass as a fuel source, which results in a fly ash that is generated from a purely organic source. While much research effort has been devoted to understanding the properties and potential productive reuse alternatives for coal combustion products, relatively little research has been done on the byproducts from biomass combustion or co-combustion. In this study, high carbon content coal ash, co-fired coal/biomass ash, and pure biomass ash from several US power plants were investigated. The ashes were characterized using a number of physical and chemical analysis techniques, including: scanning electron microscopy, laser diffraction, organic carbon content, nitrogen adsorption surface area, proximate and ultimate, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Results showed little physical, chemical, and mineralogical differentiation between coal ash and coal co-fired with biomass ash. However, the pure biomass ashes investigated in this study, showed significantly lower specific gravity, and primary oxide content, as well as coarser particle size distribution, higher residual carbon, higher heating value, and much higher specific surface area, when compared to the coal and co-fired ashes. These results have important implications on the potential for productive reuse of these waste materials.",
