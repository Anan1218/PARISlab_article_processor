Fly ashes sourced from European pulverised coal burning power plants (from Spain, The Netherlands, Italy and Greece) were characterised in terms of their chemical composition, mineralogy and physical properties. The amount and composition of the glass present in the ashes were also determined. The materials analysed have very different compositions and were selected with a view to determining their suitability for different applications and for further studies on applications. The results were compared to the literature to determine their similarities to UK coal fly ashes. Chemical analysis has enabled the categorisation of the ashes based on their oxide contents. Devitrification of the glass phase has been effected using suitable heat treatments and crystal phases formed are used as an indicator of glass reactivity. Based on leaching tests, certain ashes were identified as having limitations for some further uses due to the relatively high levels of leachable trace elements. A wide range of physical properties such as density were observed and these are related to factors such as mineralogical content and particle morphology. Keywords Fly ash Characterisation Mineralogy Trace elements Grain size 1 Introduction Over 100million tons of coal fly ash (CFA) are produced annually in the USA and EU. CFA is used mainly in the concrete and cement manufacturing industries [1]. However, CFA may have other uses, such as ceramic applications [2\u20134], synthesis of high cation exchange capacity (CEC) zeolites [5\u201311], additives for immobilization of industrial and water treatment wastes [12\u201313], land stabilization in mining areas [14], sorbents for flue gas desulfurization [15], filter material for the production of different products [16], \u2018slash\u2019 (fly ash/sludge blend) production for soil amendment [17] and as reservoirs for valuable metals, such as Al, Si, Fe, Ge, Ga, V, Ni [10,18,19]. For each of these applications it is necessary to undertake a complete characterization of the CFA involved. In this study, 23 CFAs from different European pulverised coal-fired power plants were selected with the aim of determining their chemical, mineralogical and physical properties. Furthermore, this data was compared with that for UK-fly ashes by McCarthy, et al. [20] and UKQAA [21]. Investigations were undertaken within the framework of an EU R+D project [22]. The major objective of the project was a study of a full range of CFAs that are produced in the EU with a view to determining their potential for silica extraction and zeolite synthesis. The major purpose of silica extraction is the liberation of SiO2 into an alkaline solution that can be used subsequently after separation from the ash residue with an external Al source, for the synthesis of pure zeolites [11] Characterisation was undertaken to determine the suitability of these ashes for silica extraction and conventional zeolite synthesis in a direct conversion process. The results may also serve to evaluate the suitability of the CFAs for alternative applications. 2 Experimental 2.1 Fly ash selection Twenty-three CFAs from European pulverised coal-fired power plants were selected for this study. Details of the power stations from which the ashes were sampled are given in Table 1 . All samples were collected at the electrostatic precipitators with the exception of As Pontes fly ash which is made up of a mixture of fly ash and molten slag. This selection covered most of the fly ash types produced in the European Union, from the high calcium lignite fly ash produced by many Greek power plants, to the sub-bituminous coal fly ash produced in one Spanish plant, to the more common bituminous and anthracitic fly ashes. The selection of this large number of fly ashes is required to ensure that wide ranges of Si, Al, Ca, K, Fe, glass, mullite and quartz contents are included in the study. 2.2 Characterisation of fly ashes 2.2.1 Chemical characterisation Major, minor and trace element concentrations were determined in the CFAs. The samples were acid-digested by using a special two-step digestion method devised for the analysis of trace elements in coal and combustion wastes by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) [23]. This is based on a first HNO3 extraction in closed PFA reactors under 90°C during 6h to extract the volatile metals, followed by the digestion of the solid residue (isolated with centrifugation) with HF:HNO3:HClO4. Finally, the dissolution is driven to dryness and the soluble residue re-dissolved using HNO3. The fly ash international reference material NBS 1633b was also digested to check the accuracy of the analytical and digestion methods. Silica contents were determined directly in solid samples by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), but the other elements were analysed in the acid digestions by means of ICP-MS and ICP-AES using the analytical conditions determined by Querol et al. [23] and Tait and Ault [24]. Finally, C and N contents where determined by conventional LECO elemental analysers. 2.2.2 Mineralogical characterisation The mineral composition of the fly ashes was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a SIEMENS D501 powder diffractometer with a graphite monochromator, NaI(Tl) detector and Cu Kα radiation. Final quantitative XRD analysis was performed using the Reference Intensity Method (RIM) described by Chung [25,26]. Scans were performed between 2θ values of 10\u201370° with a step size of 0.02°. CaF2 was used as an internal standard. 2.2.3 Physical characterisation The physical characterisation of fly ash included proximate analysis (moisture content and loss on ignition), density, porosity, BET surface area determinations and particle size analysis. These parameters were selected as they have an important influence on the reactivity of fly ash for zeolite synthesis as well as for other structural and chemical applications. The moisture and volatile (loss on ignition, LOI) contents were determined at 105 and 1050°C, respectively. The particle size distributions of the CFAs were determined by means of laser diffraction particle size analysis (Malvern MASTERSIZER/E®). The true density (d t) values of the samples were obtained by means of a helium pycnometer (MICROMERITICS 1330). The apparent density (d a) values were measured by means of the standard NLT-176/74, which is based on the sedimentation of powdered materials in toluene. The porosity values (P) were obtained from the d a and d t measurements [27] from the following equation: %P=100×(1−d a/d r). The BET surface area was measured with a multi-point volumetric apparatus (MICROMERITICS model ASAP 2000) by adsorbing and desorbing nitrogen on samples previously dried and out-gassed (150°C, 12h under a vacuum of 0.1mmHg). The morphologies of the particles were investigated by a JEOL JSM 840 Scanning Electron Microscope. 2.2.4 Glass composition The glass composition was computed from the chemical\u2013mineralogical mass balance. The potential Si excess over Al and the glass reactivity was investigated by de-vitrification of the glass fraction induced by thermal treatment (1100°C). The mineralogical composition of the thermally treated fly ashes was investigated and compared with the original mineralogy. If an aluminium\u2013silicate glass matrix has an excess of SiO2 over Al2O3, thermal treatment will give rise to de-vitrification processes that will result in the crystallisation of cristobalite [28,29], otherwise only mullite will crystallise. 2.2.5 Leaching tests To determine the potential mobility of trace elements from the fly ashes, the leaching test DIN 38414-S4 was applied. This DIN method requires the mixing of 100g of solid material (dry weight) with a liter of distilled water in 2l bottles during 24h [30]. The major and trace element contents in the leachates determined by means of ICP-AES and ICP-MS. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Chemical characterisation The composition of fly ash samples selected for this study is shown in Table 2 , which also includes the range determined for UK-fly ashes in UKQAA [21]. According to the classification of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM C618-92a, [31]) the following fly ashes groups may be distinguished: \u2022 F group. Most of the fly ashes investigated in the present study should be included in the class. This group have pozzolanic properties and are characterised by (a) SiO2+Al2O3+Fe2O3 >70%, (b) SO3 <5%, (c) moisture content <3% and (d) loss on ignition (LOI)<6%. Nijmegen, Sardegna, Fusina and Amer8 fly ashes show all the specifications for Class F with the exception of LOI contents that show values from 7.5 to 8.1% for these fly ashes. \u2022 C group. This group have SiO2+Al2O3+Fe2O3<70%. Lignite fly ash is the only ash from the study to fit in this group. Class C fly ashes show cementitious properties and are characterised by (a) SiO2+Al2O3+Fe2O3>50%, due to the high Ca and Mg contents (27 and 3.8%, respectively). Class C fly ash can be used as a Portland cement replacement ranging from 20\u201335% of the mass of cementitious material. Depending on major oxide contents the fly ashes may also be classified as follows: \u2022 Sialic-fly ash type. Soto de Ribera, Acid, Espiel, Monfalcone, Puertollano and CCB fly ashes contain very high alumina and silica contents (80\u201387wt%) and very low contents of major impurities (Fe, Ca, S). The Soto de Ribera, Espiel, Compostilla and Narcea fly ashes are characterised by a relatively high K2O content (4%). \u2022 Robla and Meirama fly ashes have low SiO2+Al2O3 contents (around 67wt%). \u2022 Ferro-calco-sialic fly ash type. The other fly ashes have very similar contents of alumina and silica (SiO2+Al2O3 70\u201379wt%) and different concentrations of impurities. \u2022 Escucha, As Pontes Teruel and Robla fly ash samples are characterised by a relatively high Fe content, whereas Meirama, Sardegna, Robla and Barrios fly ashes have relatively high Ca content. Levels of Mg or Mn are also relatively high due to the similar atomic radii. The range of major oxides obtained for the 23 selected fly ashes in this study are very similar to those determined for UK-fly ashes [21], with the exception of Na2O and K2O, which have higher concentration in the UK-fly ashes (0.8\u20131.8wt% Na2O and 2.3\u20134.5wt% K2O, compared to 0.2\u20131.2% Na2O and 0.7\u20133.9% K2O for the rest of the European fly ashes). The N contents (Table 2) are very low in all samples, ranging from 0.02 (Puertollano and Teruel) to 0.14wt% (Fusina). Concerning the C content (Table 2), the following classifications can be made: (a) High C samples (6.2\u20137.6wt% C): Fusina, Amer-8, Sardegna and Nijmegen; (b) intermediate C samples (2.3\u20134.6wt% C): Escucha, Barrios, Neutral, CCB, Acid, Compostilla Espiel Amer-9 and Hemweg; and (c) low C samples: the remaining fly ashes (0.6\u20131.9wt% C). These C contents are well correlated with the LOI values, with the exception of the Meirama fly ash. In this case the relatively high LOI values are probably due to the loss of sulphate. Similar LOI values were reported for UK fly ashes [20]. Table 3 shows the trace element concentrations of the fly ashes studied. Based on these data, the following fly ashes may have limitations when used for direct conversion because of their high heavy metal contents: \u2022 Puertollano fly ash has the highest Pb, Zn, Sb and Ge contents (1075, 924, 120 and 61mgkg−1, respectively), and relatively high As and Cd contents (140, 5mgkg−1, respectively). \u2022 Sardegna fly ash has the highest Ba and Sr contents (3134 and 4406mgkg−1, respectively), and relatively high B and Cr contents (393 and 235mgkg−1, respectively). \u2022 Monfalcone fly ash has the highest V content (455mgkg−1). \u2022 Hemweg-8 fly ash has very high Ba, Sr and V contents (2313, 2390 and 514mgkg−1, respectively). \u2022 The Acid fly ash has very high Ba, Cu and Sr contents (1757, 254 and 1920mgkg−1, respectively). \u2022 The CCB fly ash has a high Se content (30mgkg−1). \u2022 The UKfly ashes may have very high Ba contents (up to 36,000mgkg−1) and relatively high levels of Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn (up to 474, 81, 583, 976, 325 and 918mgkg−1, respectively [21]). \u2022 Narcea and Compostilla fly ashes (and CCB excluding Se) have the lowest trace element contents. 25, 50 and 75 percentile values for the content of trace elements in EU fly ashes are given in Table 3. 3.2 Mineralogical characterisation The major phases present in the fly ashes are aluminosilicate glass, mullite (Al6Si2O13), quartz (SiO2), magnetite (Fe3O4), anorthite/albite ((Ca,Na)(Al,Si)4O8), anhydrite (CaSO4), ettringite (3CaO Al2O3 3CaSO4 32H2O), opaline SiO2, hematite (Fe2O3) and lime (CaO). A semi-quantitative estimation of the concentrations of these mineral phases is given in Table 4 . The high glass contents (80\u201392wt%) have been found in nine of the ashes. Glass contents below 65% were found in another eight. The Barrios fly ash has a very high mullite content (40wt%). This is of special interest for potential ceramic or refractory uses of these fly ashes, but it may have a negative impact on SiO2 extraction. The Teruel, Escucha, Meirama, Puertollano, Alkaline, Soto de Ribera, As Pontes, Fusina, Monfalcone and Sardegna fly ashes have intermediate mullite contents (15\u201329wt%), whereas the rest of fly ashes have relatively low mullite levels (3\u201310wt%) and only the Lignite fly ash has no significant mullite content (<0.3wt%). Sixteen of the fly ashes have high quartz contents (6\u20132.5wt%). The quartz levels in the other fly ashes are always below 5.0wt%. The Meirama fly ash has relatively high levels of cristobalite. This probably originated from devitrification of the glass which indicates that the Meirama glass is very reactive. The Lignite and Sardegna fly ashes show the highest lime contents (5.8 and 2.5wt%, respectively). The Robla, Alkaline, Barrios, Nijmegen, Amer-8 and Fusina fly ashes also have traces of lime (1.0\u20131.9wt%) which may result in high-alkaline solutions. With respect to the Fe impurities, the Escucha, As Pontes, Puertollano, La Robla, Teruel and Lignite fly ashes have the highest hematite or magnetite contents (from 3.5 to 7wt%). The Lignite fly ash has the highest anhydrite and calcite contents (15 and 0.7wt%, respectively). The other fly ashes have very low anhydrite and calcite contents. The UK-fly ashes show similar or slightly higher glass contents, lower mullite and quartz levels, and higher magnetite and hematite contents [20] than the European fly ashes studied here. 3.3 Physical characterisation Due to the direct sampling of materials at the electrostatic precipitators, the moisture content of all fly ashes (Table 2) is very low (<1wt%), with the exception of Meirama fly ash (2.4wt%). The LOI values obtained (Table 2) show a wider range between 1.1 and 8.1wt%. Although the volatilisation or the decomposition of inorganic species may have an impact on the LOI values, the majority of the volatile content is attributed to the oxidation of partially combusted coal particles. The different LOI values may reflect combustion efficiencies. The As Pontes (mixture of fly ash and slag), Escucha, Meirama, Soto de Ribera, CCB and Monfalcone fly ashes have a coarser grain size distribution (median >40μm and percentile 90 (p90)>180μm, Table 5 ). The Narcea, Compostilla, Robla, Neutral, Acid and Amer-9 fly ashes show a finer grain size (median <20μm and p90<85μm). The other fly ashes have an intermediate grain size. The grain size distributions of these fly ashes may be grouped as follows (Fig. 1 ): (a) Normal-Gausian grain size distribution with modes around 10\u201330μm were determined for fourteen fly ashes; (b) Asymmetric grain size distribution with modes close to 100μm were obtained in only two fly ashes; and (c) Wide to bimodal grain size distribution with modes from 10 to 100μm were found in seven ashes. The true density (d t) values range between 1.3gcm−3 for CCB fly ash and 2.7gcm−3 for the La Robla fly ash (Table 5). d t values for typical ash particles with mullite and quartz inclusions range between 2.0 and 2.5gcm−3 [32]. High-Ca glass particles have d t values close or lower than 2.5gcm−3, whereas d t values >2.6gcm−3 are due to presence of free oxide phases such as lime, magnetite or hematite, or calcium salts such as anhydrite. In this study the highest d t values were measured for those samples with the highest magnetite contents such as Teruel and La Robla fly ashes (2.5 and 2.7, respectively), and the Lignite fly ash which has high lime and anhydrite contents (2.6). d t values between 2.2 to 2.4gcm−3 were obtained for most of the fly ashes with intermediate Fe oxides and/or high Ca oxide contents and/or relatively high glass contents. The lowest d t values (1.3\u20132.0gcm−3) were obtained for CCB, Neutral and Alkaline, but no discernable patterns were found that explained these low d t values. The apparent density (d a) values range between 1.1gcm−3 for the Teruel fly ash and 0.4gcm−3 for Nijmegen fly ash (Table 5). The highest d a values were obtained for high-Fe and glass fly ashes. Thus, the d a values of the Escucha and Teruel fly ashes (12 and 16wt% Fe2O·3, respectively) and the Compostilla and Espiel fly ashes (94 and 96wt% glass content) ranged between 1.0 and 1.1gcm−3. The lowest d a values are probably due to a high cenosphere content as these structures tend to be hollow. All these reported ranges on grain size distributions and density are similar than the results obtained by McCarthy et al. [20] for SIX UK fly ashes. The highest porosity values (74.7\u201381.7%) were obtained for the Sardegna, Monfalcone, Hemweg and Fusina fly ashes (Table 5), whereas the lowest values (56%) were obtained for the Escucha and Espiel fly ashes. The surface areas obtained from BET studies range between 1.3 and 12.4m2 g−1, for CCB and Meirama fly ashes, respectively (Table 5). This range is in accordance with the usual surface area measurements in fly ashes [33]. The surface area values may be enhanced by several factors such as a high carbon content [34]. This is not the case for the Meirama and As Pontes fly ashes, since their carbon contents are very low (0.6 and 1.4wt%, respectively). The irregular particle morphology in the Meirama fly ashes coupled with high particle porosity may account for the high surface area value. The other fly ashes do not show any apparent relationship between BET and C contents. With the exception of the Meirama ash, all samples studied exhibited a conventional fly ash particle morphology (spherical particles of various sizes, cenospheres and plerospheres). However, the Meirama fly ash has a very high proportion of irregularly shaped particles with high micro-porosity, usually grouped in particle agglomerates. 3.4 Glass composition The chemical and mineralogical data have been combined to elaborate a mass balance for the determination of the chemical composition of the glass matrix (Table 6 ). The results show that CCB, Escucha and Puertollano have the highest silica concentrations in the glass matrix (60\u201365wt%), whereas Lignite has the lowest (31wt%). The other fly ashes may be classified into two groups according to their silica content of the glass matrix: (a) Alkaline, Amer-8 and 9, Robla, Nijmegen and Sardegna (45\u201348wt% silica); and (b) Acid, Barrios, Espiel, Fusina, Hemweg, Meirama, Montfalcone, Narcea, Neutral, Soto and Teruel (50\u201355wt%). The silica/alumina ratios of the glass matrices ranged from 9.4 and 4.2 for Meirama and Barrios, respectively to 1.7 and 1.0 for Nijmegen and Lignite, respectively. Most of the glass matrices showed a silica/alumina ratio of between 2.0 and 3.4. Fig. 2 shows the high silica/alumina/calcium oxide ratio of the glass matrix in Meirama and Barrios and the low silica content of Lignite. The low silica content of Lignite is a consequence of the CaO enrichment of the glass matrix, whereas the high Si/Al ratio of the glass matrix of the Meirama fly ash (on the field of cristobalite in Fig. 2 explains the occurrence of opaline silica formed by de-vitrification processes. As expected from the common mullite occurrence in the fly ashes, the Si/Al/Ca ratios obtained for the glass matrix of the samples studied are within the phase field for mullite crystallisation (Fig. 2). There is an upper limit of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio for each glass content in the ash as is shown by the plot of these two properties in Fig. 3 . Ashes with high glass content tend to have a low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. This may be caused by the crystallisation of mullite during the early stages of ash formation. When mullite is separated from an initially homogeneous amorphous phase by fractional crystallisation, the glass residue phase becomes enriched in SiO2 and the quantity of glass will decrease. The only ash that violates this rule is the Meirama, and this falls outside the diagram (SiO2/Al2O3=9.3). This limit is applicable because the line drawn in Fig. 3 intercepts the 100% ash axis at around 2, a value that coincides with the whole rock SiO2/Al2O3 ratio as shown in Table 2 (equivalent to the ratio in glass when the ashes are completely vitrified). 3.5 Thermal de-vitrification The potential Si/Al excess and the glass reactivity was investigated by de-vitrification induced by thermal treatment (1100°C). If an aluminium\u2013silicate glass matrix has an excess of SiO2 over Al2O3, the thermal treatment will give rise to de-vitrification resulting in the crystallisation of SiO2, whereas if the silica is equilibrated with alumina or with calcium or iron oxides, the crystallisation of mullite and anorthite or hercynite will take place. Thus, if the glass crystallises for a given fly ash and gives rise to high temperature silica, the suitability for silica extraction may be inferred due to the high SiO2 content and high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the glass. However, if the thermal treatment results in the crystallisation of mullite or anorthite, the suitability for direct conversion may be inferred because of the balanced SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the glass. Furthermore, thermal treatment may enhance silica extraction due to the de-vitrification of relatively soluble silica; or the crystallisation of mullite (a highly insoluble phase) that may account for the immobilisation of alumina. Table 7 shows the mineral contents of the fly ashes thermally treated at 1100°C. The major mineral transformations induced in the original fly ash components due to the thermal treatment may be summarised as follows: \u2022 Crystallisation of mullite (Al6Si2O13) and cristobalite (SiO2) from the aluminium\u2013silicate glass in fly ash with low Ca contents. Barrios, Meirama, Teruel, Puertollano, Neutral, Fusina and Monfalcone fly ashes resulted in the crystallisation of cristobalite due to the high SiO2 contents of the glass matrix. Consequently, these fly ashes have the potential for SiO2 extraction due to the silica excess in the glass matrix. \u2022 Crystallisation of anorthite ((Ca,Na)(Al,Si)4O8) from the aluminium\u2013silicate glass and the original quartz in the fly ash with higher Ca content (mainly in Barrios, Meirama, Robla, Alkaline, Nijmegen, Amer8, Amer9, Fusina and Sardegna). \u2022 Crystallisation of hercynite (FeAl2O4) from the aluminosilicate glass in the Soto de Ribera and Narcea fly ashes. \u2022 Oxidation of magnetite (Fe3O4) to give hematite (Fe2O3). 3.6 Leaching test The results of the leaching experiments using the standard DIN-38414 are summarised in Table 8 . The following trends are highlighted from the results obtained: \u2022 pH values measured for the leachates ranged from 10.4 to 12.5 for most of the fly ashes in agreement with the free lime content. Acid, Neutral, As Pontes, Meirama and Compostilla gave rise to lower alkalinity leachates (pH from 8.3 and 9.7) and CCB and Puertollano gave rise to slightly acidic leachates (6.4 pH). \u2022 The conductivity of the leachates ranged from 1300 to 1800μScm−1 for most of the fly ashes. The lowest conductivity values were obtained for Puertollano, Espiel, Acid and CCB (340\u2013680μScm−1), whereas Barrios, Alkaline, Lignite, Fusina and Sardegna reached very high values (4400\u20136600μScm−1). The conductivity values are directly related to the free lime (leachable Ca) and leachable sulphate. Thus leachable Ca contents ranged from 6000 to 9000μgg−1 for the last group of fly ashes. \u2022 The leachable Si contents were found in the range of <140μgg−1 with the exception of Meirama (400 and 140μgg−1) due to the presence of soluble opaline phases. \u2022 The elements with environmental importance, such as As, B, Ba, Cr, Mo, Se, Sr and V showed the highest mobility during the leaching tests. Thus, Puertollano contained 12μgg−1 of soluble As. Escucha, Teruel, Hemweg and Montfalcone contained from 60 to 120μgg−1 of soluble B. Barrios, Sardegna, Fusina and Amer 9 contained around 15μgg−1 of soluble Ba, Lignite, Sardegna, Amer 8, Robla Barrios and Narcea contained from 4 to 9μgg−1 of soluble Cr. Fusina, Montfalcone, Hemweg, CCB, Nijmegen, Puertollano, Robla and Teruel contained around 5μgg−1 of soluble Mo. Neutral, CCB, Ameer-9, Hemweg and As Pontes contained around 3μgg−1 of soluble Se. Barrios, Nijmegen, Ameer 8 and 9, Lignite, Fusina and Sardegna contained from 60 to 270μgg−1 of soluble Sr. Monfalcone, Soto, Meirama and Espiel contained around 3μgg−1 of soluble V. Based on these results, Puertollano, Montfalcone, Fusina, Lignite, Amer 8 and 9, Sardegna and Nijmegen may have limitations for direct zeolitisation due to the relatively high levels of leachable trace elements, however, this is not a concern for other applications (such as zeolite synthesis from silica extracts). It may be concluded that these ranges of leached elements are representative of European fly ashes because they match the results of four UK fly ashes summarised previously [21].

The amount and composition of the glass present in the ashes were also determined. The materials analysed have very different compositions and were selected with a view to determining their suitability for different applications and for further studies on applications. The results were compared to the literature to determine their similarities to UK coal fly ashes. Chemical analysis has enabled the categorisation of the ashes based on their oxide contents. Devitrification of the glass phase has been effected using suitable heat treatments and crystal phases formed are used as an indicator of glass reactivity. Based on leaching tests, certain ashes were identified as having limitations for some further uses due to the relatively high levels of leachable trace elements. A wide range of physical properties such as density were observed and these are related to factors such as mineralogical content and particle morphology.",
