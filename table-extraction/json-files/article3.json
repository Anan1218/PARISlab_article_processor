Tel.: +41 58 765 4917; fax: +41 58 765 6935. In this study the hydration of quaternary Portland cements containing blast-furnace slag, type V fly ash and limestone and the relationship between the types and contents of supplementary cementitious materials and the hydrate assemblage were investigated at ages of up to 182days using X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. In addition thermodynamic modeling was used to calculate the total volume of hydrates. Two blast-furnace slag contents of 20 and 30wt.% were studied in blends containing fly ash and/or limestone at a cement replacement of 50wt.%. In all cases the experiments showed the presence of C\u2013S\u2013H, portlandite and ettringite. In samples without limestone, monosulfate was formed; in the presence of limestone monocarbonate was present instead. The addition of 5wt.% of limestone resulted in a higher compressive strength after 28days than observed for cements with lower or higher limestone content. Overall the presence of fly ash exerts little influence on the hydrate assemblage. The strength development reveals that amounts of up to 30wt.% fly ash can be used in quaternary cements without significant loss in compressive strength. Keywords Quaternary Portland cement Blast-furnace slag Fly ash Thermodynamic modeling Limestone Hydrates 1 Introduction The production of cement clinker causes 5\u20138% of the global man made CO2 emissions [1,2]. The reduction of these is an important aspect of cement research in recent years, especially as the demand for cement increases [2]. This has led to numerous studies on materials suitable to partially replace the clinker in blended cements, so-called supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs). Possible and well investigated candidates for cement substitution include silica-rich materials like blast-furnace slag (BFS), fly ash (FA) and limestone (LS) [3\u20138]. Binary systems including type V fly ash or blast-furnace slag are well studied and both materials are known to show synergistic effects with limestone in ternary systems [9\u201311]. The addition of low amounts of CaCO3 to Portland cements results in the formation of mono- and/or hemicarbonate instead of monosulfate at longer reaction times [12,13]. The formation of monocarbonate prevents the destabilization of ettringite to monosulfate as monocarbonate ( C 4 A C \u203e H 11 ) and ettringite ( C 6 A S \u203e 3 H 32 ) are more stable than monosulfate ( C 4 A S \u203e H 12 ) and calcite ( C C \u203e ) [12,14\u201316]: (1) 3 C 4 A S \u203e H 12 + 2 C C \u203e + H 18 â C 6 A S \u203e 3 H 32 + 2 C 4 A C \u203e H 11 . (Cement notation with A=Al2O3, C=CaO, C \u203e = CO 2 , H=H2O, S=SiO2, S \u203e = SO 3 . ) The stabilization of ettringite and monocarbonate in the presence of CaCO3 increases the total volume of the solid phases [8,17], which has been shown to result in higher compressive strength in OPC with low additions of limestone. The amount of ettringite and monocarbonate formed in the hydrated system depends on the quantity of Al2O3 and SO3 in the system as described in detail in [18]. However, not only the total amount of Al2O3 in the system, but also the reaction degree of the aluminum containing phases (C3A, C4AF, SCMs) is an important factor [17]. The amount and fineness of calcite plays a minor role [13]. Similar effects have been observed for blends of OPC with fly ash or blast-furnace slags [9,10,19,20]. The presence of fly ash, which contains generally more Al2O3 than OPC, leads to the formation of more AFt and AFm phases, such that the effect can be more pronounced. Investigations in OPC-LS and OPC-FA-LS cements have shown that this volume increase correlates strongly with the development of compressive strength and an increase in compressive strength has been observed up to 10wt.% limestone [9,19\u201321]. The contribution of Si-rich fly ashes to the formation of AFt and AFm phases is limited due its low reaction degree. It has been reported that after 1year only 25\u201330wt.% of the fly ash present in Portland cement blends has reacted [22\u201324]. Besides these findings, efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of cements are also reflected in the work of CEN/TC 51 WG 6 Ad-Hoc-Group \u201cCEM X\u201d. This group is concerned with the investigation and the possible standardization of ternary cement compositions in EN 197-1 [25\u201327]. However, only ternary cements containing clinker, limestone and either granulated blast-furnace slag, fly ash or pozzolans are considered. While ternary composite cements are well investigated there is a lack of knowledge regarding quaternary composite cements. The latter include three SCMs besides OPC with blast-furnace slag, limestone and Si-rich fly ash (type V according to EN 197-1) being the most commonly used materials. In terms of phase composition quaternary systems have similar composition to already existing composite cements based on OPC, including blast-furnace slag or type V fly ash [28]. Such systems might therefore be promising cement compositions. This study aims to investigate the interactions between Portland cement, blast-furnace slag, type V fly ash and limestone powder in quaternary cements with high clinker replacement level of 50wt.%. Thermodynamic modeling is applied to gain information on the formed hydrates and on the volume of those as a function of blast-furnace slag/fly ash ratio. In addition thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) is carried out to identify the hydrates formed and their changes over time. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and mix design The cement used in this study was an ordinary Portland cement (CEM I 52.5 R) (OPC) with a calcite content of 1.5wt.%. Set regulators were bassanite and gypsum with shares of 3.2 and 1.2wt.%. As cement substitutes three SCMs have been studied: a blast-furnace slag (BFS), a siliceous fly ash (type V according to EN 197-1) (FA), and a limestone powder with a calcite content of >99% (LS). The chemical and mineralogical composition of these materials determined by means of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and quantitative X-ray diffraction are given in Tables 1 and 2 . The blast-furnace slag, the fly ash and the limestone were ground separately in a laboratory ball mill, while the OPC was used as received. Fig. 1 shows the particle size distribution (PSD) of the raw materials measured by laser diffraction with a Malvern Mastersizer. The overall PSD of the OPC, the BFS and the FA do not differ significantly from each other while the limestone shows a distinct higher fraction of particles with a diameter larger than 10Î¼m. Blast-furnace slag and fly ash both consist of amorphous and crystalline compounds, which can be determined and quantified by XRD. However, no information on the composition of amorphous phases can be derived by XRD. Thus, the average composition of the amorphous content of the blast-furnace slag and the fly ash was calculated by subtracting the readily soluble alkalis and the fraction of crystalline phases from the total XRF composition and normalizing the results to 100wt.% (Table 3 ). Due to the low crystalline content of the blast-furnace slag, the composition of the amorphous content differs only slightly from the total composition. The amorphous content of the fly ash shows clear differences to the total composition, mainly in the SiO2 and Al2O3 content. This is due to the presence of mullite (19.2wt.%) and quartz (10.2wt.%). Table 4 summarizes the compositions of the investigated quaternary cements. The cement substitution level is always 50wt.%, while the SO3 level of all systems is adjusted with anhydrite to 3wt.%. Two BFS levels of 20 and 30wt.% were investigated. At both of these levels FA is gradually replaced by limestone powder in steps of 5wt.% up to a limestone content of 20wt.%. 2.2 Thermodynamic modeling Thermodynamic modeling was carried out to investigate the changes in volume of the solid phases as well as in the hydrates assemblage, both as a function of added blast-furnace slag and fly ash. The geochemical modeling program GEMS [29,30] was used with thermodynamic data from the PSI-GEMS database [31,32] supplemented by cement specific data [33,34]. C\u2013S\u2013H is described by a solid solution between Ca-rich (C1.67S1.0H2.1) and Si-rich C\u2013S\u2013H (C0.83S1.0H1.33) end-members as described in detail in [34,35]. The use of a solid solution model allows the description of varying Ca/Si ratios in the C\u2013S\u2013H. The activities of the different species were calculated from the measured total concentrations at the respective temperatures using GEMS. The activity coefficients of aqueous species yi were computed with the built-in expanded extended Debye\u2013HÃ¼ckel equation in Truesdell\u2013Jones form with common parameter a i of 3.67 for KOH solutions: (2) log Î³ i = - A y z i 2 I 1 + B y a i I + b y I , where zi denotes the charge of species i, I the effective molal ionic strength, by is a semi-empirical parameter (b â0.123 for KOH at 25Â°C), and Ay and By are P, T-dependent coefficients. This activity correction is thought to be applicable up to approx. 1M ionic strength [36]. Data on the density and the molar volume of phases considered in the thermodynamic calculations are given in Table 5 . For the thermodynamic calculations different long-term degrees of reaction were assumed to calculate the phase assemblage after longer hydration times. The used degrees of reaction are 100wt.% for OPC, 70wt.% for the blast-furnace slag and 30wt.% for the fly ash. The values for the SCMs are based on investigations of blast-furnace slag and fly ash blended Portland cements after one year of hydration [22,24,37,38]. As the crystalline phases in both SCMs are either considered to be non-reactive (e.g. quartz or mullite) or are only present in very low amounts, only the amorphous content was assumed to react. The XRD data indicate no significant reaction of the quartz and mullite present in fly ash up to 91days of hydration. This in turn means that the before mentioned overall long term degrees of reaction have to be based on the amorphous part of the blast-furnace slag and the fly ash which leads to elevated values of 71.1wt.% and 43.6 wt.%, respectively. For the calculation of C\u2013S\u2013H a solid solution of Ca-rich C\u2013S\u2013H (C1.67S1.0H2.1) and Si-rich C\u2013S\u2013H (C0.83S1.0H1.33) with varying C/S ratio has been implemented as described in detail in [34,39]. The oxide composition as given in Table 3 was used as input for the equilibrium calculations which give the mass, the volume and the composition of the modeled systems as output. 2.3 Methods of analysis 2.3.1 Investigation of cement pastes To study the phase development, cement paste samples were prepared from 200g of dry material with water to binder ratio of 0.45 using a Twister Evolution vacuum mixer from Renfert. The samples were mixed for 2min at 300rpm and stored at 20Â°C in 60ml sealed plastic vessels for TGA and XRD studies. For TGA, slices of approximately 3mm where cut from the hardened cement paste and gently crushed with a mortar and pestle. To stop the hydration the resulting powder was immersed in isopropanol for 15min and afterwards filtrated with a Buchner funnel before being flushed with diethylether in order to remove all remaining isopropanol. Drying of the filter cake in a compartment dryer at 40Â°C for 8min assured the elimination of remaining diethylether. The analysis was carried out directly afterwards on approximately 50mg of the resulting powder using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851e by monitoring the weight while heating up from 30 to 980Â°C at a heating rate of 20Â°C/min under nitrogen atmosphere. The corresponding changes in bound water and portlandite as given in Table 7 are calculated as percentage of the dry sample weight at 500Â°C according to (3) BW = m total - m dry solids m dry solids Â· 100 [ % ] , and (4) CH = m H 2 O CH m dry solids Â· M ( Ca ( OH ) 2 ) M ( H 2 O ) Â· 100 [ % ] = m H 2 O CH m dry solids Â· 74 18 Â· 100 [ % ] , with m total =total mass of \u201cwet\u201d paste, m dry solids =mass of dry paste corresponding to sample weight at 500Â°C, m H 2 O CH =weight loss due to dehydroxylation of portlandite obtained by the tangent method, M(Ca(OH)2)=molar mass of portlandite and M(H2O)=molar mass of H2O. For XRD experiments, slices where immersed in isopropanol for 20min followed by drying at 40Â°C for 15min. As immersion in isopropanol is known to affect hydrate phases [40] this procedure was kept as short as possible to avoid loss of information. The slices were placed in a PANalytical X\u2019Pert Pro MPD diffractometer in a Î¸ â2Î¸ configuration with an incident beam monochromator and CuKÎ± radiation (Î» =1.54Ã). The samples were scanned for 120min between 5Â° and 75Â° with an X\u2019Celerator detector. For the evaluation of the gained data in terms of phase identification the X\u2019Pert High Score Plus program version 3.0e from PANalytical was used. 2.3.2 Compressive strength of mortar samples Compressive strength of mortar prisms was determined after 2, 7 and 28days according to EN 196-1. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thermodynamic modeling Thermodynamic modeling was applied to investigate the influence of limestone on the hydrate assemblage (Fig. 2 ). To illustrate the effect of limestone a CO2-free OPC containing 30wt.% fly ash and 20wt.% blast-furnace slag was chosen as starting composition. In the absence of CaCO3, C\u2013S\u2013H and monosulfate are calculated to be the main hydrates in a ternary system with 20wt.% blast-furnace slag. The partial replacement of fly ash by CaCO3 is calculated to lead to the consumption of portlandite as the SiO2 present in the fly ash will react with Ca(OH)2 according to Eq. (5): (5) y Ca ( OH ) 2 + SiO 2 + x H 2 O â y CaO Â· SiO 2 Â· ( y + x ) H 2 O. The complete replacement of fly ash by CaCO3 leads to the presence of more portlandite as no pozzolanic reaction occurs. A replacement of fly ash by CaCO3 leads to the formation of hemicarbonate, monocarbonate and more ettringite instead of monosulfate according to Eqs. (6) and (7) (additional information on the stoichiometry of AFm amd AFt phases are presented in Table 6 ): (6) 3 C 4 A S \u203e H 12 + CH + C C \u203e + 19 H â C 6 A S \u203e 3 H 32 + 2 C 4 A C \u203e 0.5 H 12 ( 3 Ã 309 cm 3 + 33 cm 3 + 37 cm 3 â 707 cm 3 + 2 Ã 285 cm 3 ; Î V = 28 vol . % ) (7) 3 C 4 A S \u203e H 12 + 2 C C \u203e + 18 H â C 6 A S \u203e 3 H 32 + 2 C 4 A C \u203e H 11 ( see also Eq. ( 1 ) ) ( 3 Ã 309 cm 3 + 2 Ã 37 cm 3 â 707 cm 3 + 2 Ã 262 cm 3 ; Î V = 23 vol . % ) Numbers in parentheses shows the molar volume of solids and the volume gain due to the reaction with respect to the reactants. In the presence of more CaCO3, monocarbonate is stable according to Eq. (7). From the diffractograms given in Fig. 4 it can be seen that both, hemicarbonate and monocarbonate are present at 182days of hydration. In experimental studies, initially the formation of hemicarbonate is observed as the formation of monocarbonate is kinetically slow [13]. In the long term a transformation of hemicarbonate to monocarbonate is observed. These effects result in a maximum volume of stable hydrates at about 3wt.% CaCO3 content, similar to the effects observed for ternary OPC-BFS-LS and OPC-FA-LS systems [10,17]. Investigations of OPC-limestone and OPC-FA-LS cements have shown that this volume maximum correlates with a maximum of compressive strength [9,19\u201321]. This positive effect is enhanced by increasing Al2O3 content as more ettringite can be stabilized by CaCO3. Thus, the partial substitution of OPC by blast-furnace slag and fly ash should increase the positive effect of the presence of CaCO3. However, the contribution of blast-furnace slag and fly ash to the amount of Al2O3 that is available to form monocarbonate and to stabilize ettringite is limited as both materials exhibit slower reaction rates than OPC. Furthermore, the used blast-furnace slag has a low Al2O3 content. After one year, the reaction of approximately 25\u201330wt.% of fly ash and 70wt.% of blast-furnace slag has been reported [22\u201324,37,38]. Considering the only partial reaction of fly ash and blast-furnace slag, blast-furnace slag contributes approx. 6wt.% and fly ash approx. 8wt.% of reactive Al2O3. Thus, their presence increases the amount of available Al2O3 in the long term. Thermodynamic modeling was also used to study the influence of different fractions of fly ash and blast-furnace slag on the hydrate assemblage. In a ternary system containing 50wt.% of blast-furnace slag and 5wt.% of CaCO3 as shown on the left hand side of Fig. 3, the main hydrates are calcium silicate hydrate (C\u2013S\u2013H), ettringite, monocarbonate, hydrotalcite and portlandite. Successive replacement of blast-furnace slag by fly ash exerts different effects: (i) The total volume of hydrated binder and the amount of C\u2013S\u2013H is slightly reduced due to the lower degree of reaction of the fly ash compared to the blast-furnace slag. (ii) Decrease of the volume of portlandite caused by the pozzolanic reaction with the SiO2 from the fly ash. (iii) The higher Al2O3 and the lower MgO content of the fly ash lead to an increase in monocarbonate and a decrease in hydrotalcite. If a complete reaction of the binder would have been assumed a slightly higher total volume of hydrates would be obtained for the fly ash rich blends, mainly due to the formation of additional C\u2013S\u2013H. Furthermore the complete depletion of portlandite and the formation of strÃ¤tlingite at high fly ash contents would be calculated as has been shown elsewhere [8]. Thermodynamic modeling predicts no or very little portlandite, as a homogeneous system with C\u2013S\u2013H of C/Sâ¼1.5 is predicted. In real systems generally the presence of significant quantities of portlandite is still observed while C\u2013S\u2013H with a more variable C/S from 1.2 to 1.6 is present [17,41]. Due to inhomogeneities and a disconnected pore network portlandite can persist in some parts of the microstructure while in other areas a low C/S is present. SEM/EDX investigations in blended Portland cements showed a very inhomogeneous microstructure [17,40]; in some areas portlandite persisted while in others the C/S of the C\u2013S\u2013H equaled to 1.2. Such inhomogeneous distribution of the C/S cannot be captured by thermodynamic modeling. In this study quaternary blends with two different blast-furnace slag levels were investigated as indicated in Fig. 3. The calculated total volume of solids as shown in Fig. 2 decreases only very slightly by 1vol.% from 30wt.% to 20wt.% blast-furnace slag content. The corresponding changes in bound water, C\u2013S\u2013H and portlandite are calculated using GEMS as given in Table 7 . 3.2 Hydrates present Results of TGA and XRD investigations at 182days of hydration for selected samples containing 20wt.% blast-furnace slag at different fly ash and limestone quantities are depicted in Figs. 4 and 5. In absence of limestone, the main phases detected by XRD and TGA are calcium silicate hydrate (C\u2013S\u2013H), ettringite, AFm phases (mainly hemicarbonate and a mixed AFm containing sulfate, carbonate and hydroxide [42]) and portlandite. The presence of limestone leads to the formation of hemi- and monocarbonate instead of the monosulfate phases [12]. Furthermore slightly more ettringite is detected as can be seen from the TGA data. XRD data recorded at different sample ages (not presented here) show that during the first weeks only hemicarbonate is observed, while hemi- and monocarbonate are both present at later ages. However, from a thermodynamic point of view only monocarbonate is stable. This initial kinetic hindrance of the monocarbonate formation has previously been reported, e.g. by [12,13]. The formation of mono- and hemicarbonate prevents the monosulfate formation, indirectly stabilizes ettringite (Fig. 2) and is the cause for the increased ettringite content as can be seen from Fig. 5. The slight increase of portlandite in the presence of 5 and 15wt.% limestone is due to the simultaneous reduction of the fly ash content whereby less portlandite is consumed to form C\u2013S\u2013H (see Fig. 6 ). XRD experiments on systems containing 30wt.% blast-furnace slag do not show differences to the data presented in Fig. 4. As shown in Table 8 the bound water content increases up to 91days in all systems. After 91 and 182days the total bound water content is comparable to calculated values (as given in Table 7). The samples with higher blast-furnace slag content have slightly more bound water in agreement with the modeling. This observation underpins the faster reaction of the blast-furnace slag. The portlandite content does not vary significantly between the two blast-furnace slag levels and does not indicate a strong influence of the fly ash used on the extent of the pozzolanic reaction. The portlandite contents are slightly lower in the samples containing more fly ash which is in agreement with the calculated trends in Figs. 2 and 3. The absolute portlandite quantities determined by TGA decrease slowly with time but are considerably higher than the modeled ones even after 182days. This could be related to a lower degree of fly ash reaction than assumed or also due to a inhomogeneous system with lower Ca/Si ratio of C\u2013S\u2013H, as has been observed by [17,19]. 3.3 Development of compressive strength The development of compressive strength up to 28days is shown in Fig. 7 . At 2 and 7days all strength values are located in the same range independent from the composition of the systems. The highest values are reached with 5wt.% additional limestone while both, higher limestone content or limestone absence lead to lower compressive strength. Thus, the presence of low quantities of limestone increases compressive strength as observed in OPC or OPC-FA blends [11,43]. CaCO3 is able to take part actively in the hydration reaction up to 2\u20133wt.% as shown in the thermodynamic calculations presented in Fig. 2. This chemical reaction of limestone has also been reported by [12,44]. At higher shares the remaining calcite will only act passively as filler. The filler effect itself is characterized by supplying higher specific surface available for nucleation and a higher effective water/cement ratio [44\u201346]. The amount of calcite that is able to react depends on the available Al2O3 and thereby on the present SCMs and their composition. The calculated effect of the blast-furnace slag and fly ash contents as a function of CaCO3 on the total volume of solids is depicted in Fig. 8 . All systems blended with blast-furnace slag and/or fly ash show a slightly lower volume of solids compared to OPC. Cement substitution by blast-furnace slag leads to slightly higher calculated volume of solids than substitution by fly ash due to the limited reactivity of the latter. When both materials are incorporated the volume of solids increases with increasing blast-furnace slag content. Blast-furnace slag can form significantly more C\u2013S\u2013H than fly ash due to its faster reaction. The Al2O3 available for reaction from the fly ash leads to more monocarbonate but this cannot compensate for the lower C\u2013S\u2013H content. The steeper decrease of the blast-furnace slag system that is visible from about 2wt.% CaCO3 originates from a decrease in blast-furnace slag content and thereby a decrease in hydrotalcite as well. The formation of hydrotalcite requires both Al2O3 and MgO. The first is provided by the fly ash and the latter by blast-furnace slag. Al2O3 is known to be preferably bound in hydrotalcite [47,48]. As this phase remains constant in the fly ash containing systems a less steep decrease is visible that mainly results from a decrease in C\u2013S\u2013H with decreasing blast-furnace slag content. A slightly higher calculated total volume of solids with higher blast furnace slag content goes along very well with the slightly higher compressive strength observed for corresponding systems (Fig. 7). 4 Conclusions The present study shows the effect of the binder composition in quaternary OPC systems with 50wt.% cement substitution by blast-furnace slag, siliceous fly ash and limestone. (i) The relative fraction of blast-furnace slag, siliceous fly ash or limestone in OPC-blends with 50wt.% substitution exerts no significant influence on strength development at early ages up to 7days. At later ages, a CaCO3 content of 2\u20135wt.% leads to the stabilization of monocarbonate and ettringite, a maximum volume of hydrates (Figs. 2 and 8) and thus to a higher compressive strength as shown in Fig. 7. (ii) The ideal amount of additional limestone depends on the composition and amounts of incorporated fly ash and/or blast-furnace slag as well as the total SO3. Further on the amount of CaCO3 that is already incorporated in OPC has to be taken into account. (iii) The types of hydrates present in ternary or quaternary blends with 50wt.% of OPC are similar to OPC. However, there are some differences in the volume of hydrates and less portlandite is present in blended OPC while more C\u2013S\u2013H and AFm phases can be observed. (iv) The presence of both, fly ash and blast-furnace slag, has little effect on the hydrate assemblage. The replacement of some blast-furnace slag by fly ash leads to a slight decrease in the amount of portlandite and C\u2013S\u2013H and to the formation of more AFm phases (monocarbonate and hemicarbonate). Portlandite is consumed in the pozzolanic reaction with the fly ash to form C\u2013S\u2013H. However, the limited assumed degree of reaction as well as the low amorphous content of the fly ash itself leads to lower calculated C\u2013S\u2013H. The low reactivity also causes the slightly reduced total volume of solids and compressive strength at high fly ash content. Yet, these effects are small and consequently amounts of up to 30wt.% fly ash can be used in quaternary blends without significant loss of compressive strength.

        "dc:description": "In this study the hydration of quaternary Portland cements containing blast-furnace slag, type V fly ash and limestone and the relationship between the types and contents of supplementary cementitious materials and the hydrate assemblage were investigated at ages of up to 182days using X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. In addition thermodynamic modeling was used to calculate the total volume of hydrates. Two blast-furnace slag contents of 20 and 30wt.% were studied in blends containing fly ash and/or limestone at a cement replacement of 50wt.%. In all cases the experiments showed the presence of C\u2013S\u2013H, portlandite and ettringite. In samples without limestone, monosulfate was formed; in the presence of limestone monocarbonate was present instead. The addition of 5wt.% of limestone resulted in a higher compressive strength after 28days than observed for cements with lower or higher limestone content. Overall the presence of fly ash exerts little influence on the hydrate assemblage. The strength development reveals that amounts of up to 30wt.% fly ash can be used in quaternary cements without significant loss in compressive strength.",
